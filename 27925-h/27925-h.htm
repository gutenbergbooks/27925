<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE HOLY OILS.</h3>


<p>Horace Endicott once believed that life began for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
the day he married Sonia Westfield. The ten months
spent with the young wife were of a hue so roseate as to
render discussion of the point foolish. His youth had
been a happy one, of the roystering, innocent kind: noisy
with yachting, baseball, and a moderate quantity of college
beer, but clean, as if his mother had supervised it; yet he
had never really lived in his twenty-five years, until the
blessed experience of a long honeymoon and a little housekeeping
with Sonia had woven into his life the light of
sun and moon and stars together. However, as he admitted
long afterwards, his mistake was as terrible as
convincing. Life began for him that day he sat in the
railway carriage across the aisle from distinguished Monsignor
O'Donnell, prelate of the Pope's household, doctor
in theology, and vicar-general of the New York diocese.
The train being on its way to Boston, and the journey
dull, Horace whiled away a slow hour watching the Monsignor,
and wondering what motives govern the activity
of the priests of Rome. The priest was a handsome man of
fifty, dark-haired, of an ascetic pallor, but undoubtedly
practical, as his quick and business-like movements testified.
His dark eyes were of fine color and expression,
and his manners showed the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Some years ago," thought Horace, "I would have
studied his person for indications of hoofs and horns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>&mdash;so
strangely was I brought up. He is just a poor fellow
like myself&mdash;it is as great a mistake to make these men
demi-gods as to make them demi-devils&mdash;and he denies
himself a wife as a Prohibitionist denies himself a drink.
He goes through his mummeries as honestly as a parson
through his sermons or a dervish through his dances&mdash;it's
all one, and we must allow for it in the make-up of
human nature. One man has his parson, another his
priest, a third his dervish&mdash;and I have Sonia."</p>

<p>This satisfactory conclusion he dwelt upon lovingly, unconscious
that the Monsignor was now observing him in
turn.</p>

<p>"A fine boy," the priest thought, "with <i>man</i> written all
over him. Honest face, virtuous expression, daring too,
loving-hearted, lovable, clever, I'm sure, and his life has
been too easy to develop any marked character. Too
young to have been in the war, but you may be sure he
wanted to go, and his mother had to exercise her authority
to keep him at home. He has been enjoying me for
an hour.... I'm as pleasant as a puzzle to him ... he
preferred to read me rather than Dickens, and I gather
from his expression that he has solved me. By this time
I am rated in his mind as an impostor. Oh, the children
of the Mayflower, how hard for them to see anything in
life except through the portholes of that ship."</p>

<p>With a sigh the priest returned to his book, and the
two gentlemen, having had their fill of speculation, forgot
each other directly and forever. At this point the accident
occurred. The slow train ran into a train ahead, which
should have been farther on at that moment. All the
passengers rose up suddenly, without any ceremony, quite
speechless, and flew up the car like sparrows. Then the
car turned on its left side, and Horace rolled into the outstretched
arms and elevated legs of Monsignor O'Donnell.
He was kicked and embraced at the same moment, receiving
these attentions in speechless awe, as he could not recall
who was to blame for the introduction and the attitude.
For a moment he reasoned that they had become
the object of most outrageous ridicule from the other passengers;
for these latter had suddenly set up a shouting
and screeching very scandalous. Horace wondered if the
priest would help him to resent this storm of insult, and
he raised himself off the Monsignor's face, and removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the rest of his person from the Monsignor's body, in order
the more politely to invite him to the battle. Then he
discovered the state of things in general. The overthrown
car was at a stand-still. That no one was hurt seemed
happily clear from the vigorous yells of everybody, and the
fine scramble through the car-windows. The priest got
up leisurely and felt himself. Next he seized his satchel
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Now it was more than an accident that I brought the
holy oils along," said he to Horace. "I was vexed to find
them where they shouldn't be, yet see how soon I find use
for them. Someone must be badly hurt in this disaster,
and of course it'll be one of my own."</p>

<p>"I hope," said the other politely, "that I did you no
harm in falling on you. I could not very well help it."</p>

<p>"Fortune was kinder to you than if the train rolled over
the other way. Don't mention it, my son. I'll forgive
you, if you will find me the way out, and learn if any have
been injured."</p>

<p>The window was too small for a man of the Monsignor's
girth, but through the rear door the two crawled out comfortably,
Monsignor dragging the satchel and murmuring
cheerfully: "How lucky! the holy oils!" It was just
sundown, and the wrecked train lay in a meadow, with a
pretty stream running by, whose placid ripplings mocked
the tumult of the mortals examining their injuries in the
field. Yet no one had been seriously injured. Bruises
and cuts were plentiful, some fainted from shock, but each
was able to do for himself, not so much as a bone having
been broken. For a few minutes the Monsignor rejoiced
that he would have no use for what he called the holy oils.
Then a trainman came running, white and broken-tongued,
crying out: "There was a priest on the train&mdash;who
has seen him?" It turned out that the fireman
had been caught in the wrecked locomotive, and crushed
to death.</p>

<p>"And it's a priest he's cryin' for, sir," groaned the
trainman, as he came up to the Monsignor. The dying
man lay in the shade of some trees beside the stream, and
a lovely woman had his head in her lap, and wept silently
while the poor boy gasped every now and then "mother"
and "the priest." She wiped the death-dew from his face,
from which the soot had been washed with water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
stream, and moistened his lips with a cordial. He was a
youth, of the kind that should not die too early, so vigorous
was his young body, so manly and true his dear face;
but it was only a matter of ten minutes stay beside the
little stream for Tim Hurley. The group about him made
way for Monsignor, who sank on his knees beside him,
and held up the boy's face to the fading light.</p>

<p>"The priest is here, Tim," he said gently, and Endicott
saw the receding life rush back with joy into the agonized
features. With something like a laugh he raised his inert
hands, and seized the hands of the priest, which he covered
with kisses.</p>

<p>"I shall die happy, thanks be to God," he said weakly;
"and, father, don't forget to tell my mother. It's her
last consolation, poor dear."</p>

<p>"And I have the holy oils, Tim," said Monsignor softly.</p>

<p>Another rush of light to the darkening face!</p>

<p>"Tell her that, too, father dear," said Tim.</p>

<p>"With my own lips," answered Monsignor.</p>

<p>The bystanders moved away a little distance, and the
lady resigned her place, while Tim made his last confession.
Endicott stood and wondered at the sight; the priest
holding the boy's head with his left arm, close to his bosom
and Tim grasping lovingly the hand of his friend, while he
whispered in little gasps his sins and his repentance;
briefly, for time was pressing. Then Monsignor called
Horace and bade him support the lad's head; and also
the lovely lady and gave her directions "for his mother's
sake." She was woman and mother both, no doubt, by
the way she served another woman's son in his fatal distress.
The men brought her water from the stream.
With her own hands she bared his feet, bathed and wiped
them, washed his hands, and cried tenderly all the time.
Horace shuddered as he dried the boy's sweating forehead,
and felt the chill of that death which had never yet come
near him. He saw now what the priest meant by the holy
oils. Out of his satchel Monsignor took a golden cylinder,
unscrewed the top, dipped his thumb in what appeared to
be an oily substance, and applied it to Tim's eyes, to his
ears, his nose, his mouth, the palms of his hands, and the
soles of his feet, distinctly repeating certain Latin invocations
as he worked. Then he read for some time from a
little book, and finished by wiping his fingers in cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and returning all to the satchel again. There was a look
of supreme satisfaction on his face.</p>

<p>"You are all right now, Tim," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"All right, father," repeated the lad faintly, "and
don't forget to tell mother everything, and say I died
happy, praising God, and that she won't be long after me.
And let Harry Cutler"&mdash;the engineer came forward and
knelt by his side&mdash;"tell her everything. She knew how
he liked me and a word from him was more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice faded away.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her," murmured the engineer brokenly, and
slipped away in unbearable distress. The priest looked
closer into Tim's face.</p>

<p>"He's going fast," he said, "and I'll ask you all to
kneel and say amen to the last prayers for the boy."</p>

<p>The crowd knelt by the stream in profound silence, and
the voice of the priest rose like splendid music, touching,
sad, yet to Horace unutterably pathetic and grand.</p>

<p>"Go forth, O Christian soul," the Monsignor read,
"in the name of God the Father Almighty, who created
thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,
who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Ghost,
who was poured forth upon thee; in the name of the
Angels and Archangels; in the name of the Thrones and
Dominations; in the name of the Principalities and
Powers; in the name of the Cherubim and Seraphim; in
the name of the Patriarchs and Prophets; in the name of
the holy Apostles and Evangelists; in the name of the
holy Martyrs and Confessors; in the name of the holy
Monks and Hermits; in the name of the holy Virgins and
of all the Saints of God; may thy place be this day in
peace, and thy abode in holy Sion. Through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen."</p>

<p>Then came a pause and the heavy sigh of the dying one
shook all hearts. Endicott did not dare to look down at
the mournful face of the fireman, for a terror of death had
come upon him, that he should be holding the head of
one condemned to the last penalty of nature; at the same
moment he could not help thinking that a king might not
have been more nobly sent forth on his journey to judgment
than humble Tim Hurley. Monsignor took another
look at the lad's face, then closed his book, and took off
the purple ribbon which had hung about his neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's over. The man's dead," he announced to the
silent crowd. There was a general stir, and a movement
to get a closer look at the quiet body lying on the grass.
Endicott laid the head down and rose to his feet. The
woman who had ministered to the dying so sweetly tied
up his chin and covered his face, murmuring with tears,
"His poor mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, there is the heart to be pitied," sighed the Monsignor.
"This heart aches no more, but the mother's
will ache and not die for many a year perhaps."</p>

<p>Endicott heard his voice break, and looking saw that
the tears were falling from his eyes, he wiping them away
in the same matter-of-fact fashion which had marked his
ministrations to the unfortunate fireman.</p>

<p>"Death is terrible only to those who love," he added,
and the words sent a pang into the heart of Horace. It
had never occurred to him that death was love's most
dreaded enemy,&mdash;that Sonia might die while love was
young.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE NIGHT AT THE TAVERN.</h3>


<p>The travelers of the wrecked train spent the night at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the nearest village, whither all went on foot before darkness
came on. Monsignor took possession of Horace, also
of the affections of the tavern-keeper, and of the best
things which belonged to that yokel and his hostelry. It
was prosperity in the midst of disaster that he and Endicott
should have a room on the first floor, and find
themselves comfortable in ten minutes after their arrival.
By the time they had enjoyed a refreshing meal, and discussed
the accident to the roots, Horace Endicott felt
that his soul was at ease with the Monsignor, who at no
time had displayed any other feeling than might arise
from a long acquaintance with the young man. One
would have pronounced the two men, as they settled down
into the comfort of their room, two collegians who had
traveled much together.</p>

<p>"It was an excellent thing that I brought the holy oils
along," Monsignor said, as if Endicott had no other interest
in life than this particular form of excellence. To a
polite inquiry he explained the history, nature, and use of
the mysterious oils.</p>

<p>"I can understand how a ceremony of that kind would
soothe the last hours of Tim Hurley," said the pagan
Endicott, "but I am curious, if you will pardon me, to
know if the holy oils would have a similar effect on Monsignor
O'Donnell."</p>

<p>"The same old supposition," chuckled the priest, "that
there is one law for the crowd, the mob, the diggers, and
another for the illuminati. Now, let me tell you, Mr.
Endicott, that with all his faith Tim Hurley could not
have welcomed priest and oils more than I shall when I
need them. The anguish of death is very bitter, which
you are too young to know, and it is a blessed thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
have a sovereign ready for that anguish in the Sacrament
of Extreme Unction. The Holy Oils are the thing which
Macbeth desired when he demanded so bitterly of the
physician.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>That is my conviction. So if you are near when I am
going to judgment, come in and see how emphatically I
shall demand the holy oils, even before a priest be willing
to bring them."</p>

<p>"It seems strange," Horace commented, "very strange.
I cannot get at your point of view at all."</p>

<p>Then he went on to ask questions rapidly, and Monsignor
had to explain the meaning of his title, a hundred
things connected with his priesthood, and to answer
many objections to his explanations; until the night had
worn on to bedtime, and the crowd of guests began to
depart from the verandahs. It was all so interesting to
Horace. In the priest and his conversation he had caught
a glimpse of a new world both strange and fascinating.
Curious too was the profound indifference of men like
himself&mdash;college men&mdash;to its existence. It did not seem
possible that the Roman idea could grow into proportions
under the bilious eyes of the omniscient Saxon, and not
a soul be aware of its growth! However, Monsignor was
a pleasant man, a true college lad, an interesting talker,
with music in his voice, and a sincere eye. He was not
a controversialist, but a critic, and he did not seem to
mind when Horace went off into a dream of Sonia, and
asked questions far from the subject.</p>

<p>Long afterwards Endicott recalled a peculiarity of this
night, which escaped his notice at the time: his sensitiveness
to every detail of their surroundings, to the colors
of the room, to the shades of meaning in the words of
the Monsignor, to his tricks of speech and tone, quite
unusual in Horace's habit. Sonia complained that he
never could tell her anything clear or significant of places
he had seen. The room which had been secured from the
landlord was the parlor of the tavern; long and low,
colonial in the very smell of the tapestry carpet, with
doors and mantel that made one think of John Adams and
General Washington. The walls had a certain terror in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
them, a kind of suspense, as when a jury sits petrified
while their foreman announces a verdict of death. A long
line of portraits in oil produced this impression. The
faces of ancient neighbors, of the Adams, the Endicotts,
the Bradburys, severe Puritans, for whom the name of
priest meant a momentary stoppage of the heart, looked
coldly and precisely straight out from their frames on the
Monsignor. Horace fancied that they exchanged glances.
What fun it would have been to see the entire party move
out from their frames, and put the wearer of the Roman
purple to shameful flight.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they don't let you sleep to-night," he said to
the priest, who laughed at the conceit.</p>

<p>A cricket came out on the window-sill, chirped at
Horace's elbow, and fled at the sound of near voices.
Through the thick foliage of the chestnut trees outside
he could see stars at times that made him think of Sonia's
eyes. The wind shook the branches gently, and made
little moans and whispers in the corners, as if the ghosts
of the portraits were discussing the sacrilege of the Monsignor's
presence. Horace thought at the time his nerves
were strung tight by the incidents of the day, and his
interest deeply stirred by the conversation of the priest;
since hitherto he had always thought of wind as a thing
that blew disagreeably except at sea, noisy insects as public
nuisances to be caught and slain, and family portraits the
last praiseworthy attempt of ancestors to disturb the sleep
of their remote heirs. When he had somewhat tired of
asking his companion questions, it occurred to him that
the Monsignor had asked none in return, and might waive
his right to this privilege of good-fellowship. He mentioned
the matter.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Monsignor, "but I know all about
you. See now if I give you a good account of your life
and descent."</p>

<p>He was promenading the room before the picture-jury
frowning on him. He looked at them a moment solemnly.</p>

<p>"Indeed I know what I would have to expect from you,"
he said to the portraits, "if you were to sit upon my case
to-night. Your descendant here is more merciful."</p>

<p>They laughed together.</p>

<p>"Well," to Horace, "you asked me many questions,
because you know nothing about me or mine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
although we have been on the soil this half century.
The statesmen of your blood disdain me. This scorn
is in the air of New England, and is part of your
marrow. Here is an example of it. Once on a vacation
I spent a few weeks in the house of a Puritan lady, who
learned of my faith and blood only a week before my
leaving. She had been very kind, and when I bade her
good-by I assured her that I would remember her in my
prayers. 'You needn't mind,' she replied, 'my own prayers
are much better than any you can say.' This temper explains
why you have to ask questions about me, and I have
none to ask concerning you."</p>

<p>Horace had to admit the contention.</p>

<p>"Life began for you near the river that turned the
wheel of the old sawmill. Ah, that river! It was the
beginning of history, of time, of life! It came from
the beyond and it went over the rim of the wonderful
horizon, singing and laughing like a child. How often
you dreamed of following it to its end, where you were
certain a glory, felt only in your dreams, filled the land.
The fishes only could do that, for they had no feet to be
tired by walking. Your first mystery was that wheel which
the water turned: a monstrous thing, a giant, ugly and
deadly, whose first movement sent you off in terror. How
could it be that the gentle, smiling, yielding water, which
took any shape from a baby hand, had power to speed that
giant! The time came when you bathed in the stream,
mastered it, in spite of the terror which it gave you one
day when it swallowed the life of a comrade. Do you remember
this?"</p>

<p>Monsignor held up his hand with two fingers stretched
out beyond the others, and gave a gentle war-whoop.
Horace laughed.</p>

<p>"I suppose every boy in the country invited his chums
to a swim that way," he said.</p>

<p>"Just so. The sign language was universal. The
old school on the village green succeeded the river
and the mill in your history. Miss Primby taught it,
dear old soul, gentler than a mother even, and you
laughed at her curls, and her funny ways, which hid
from child's eyes a noble heart. It was she who
bound up your black eye after the battle with Bouncer,
the bully, whose face and reputation you wrecked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
same hour for his oppression of the most helpless boy in
school. That feat made you the leader of the secret
society which met at awful hours in the deserted shanty
just below the sawmill. What a creep went up and down
your spine as in the chill of the evening the boys came
stealing out of the undergrowth one by one, and greeted
their chief with the password, known by every parent in
town. The stars looked down upon you as they must
have looked upon all the great conspirators of time since
the world began. You felt that the life of the government
hung by a thread, when such desperate characters took
the risk of conspiring against it. What a day was July
the Fourth&mdash;what wretches were the British&mdash;what
a hero was General Washington! What land was like
this country of the West? Its form on the globe was a
promontory while all others lay very low on the plane."</p>

<p>"In that spirit you went to Harvard and ran full
against some great questions of life. The war was on,
and your father was at the front. Only your age, your
father's orders, and your mother's need held you back
from the fight. You were your mother's son. It is
written all over you,&mdash;and me. And your father loved you
doubly that you were his son and owned her nature. He
fell in battle, and she was slain by a crueller foe, the grief
that, seizing us, will not let us live even for those we love.
God rest the faithful dead, give peace to their souls, and
complete their love and their labors! My father and
mother are living yet&mdash;the sweetest of blessings at my
time of life. You grieved as youth grieves, but life had
its compensations. You are a married man, and you love
as your parents loved, with the fire and tenderness of
both. Happy man! Fortunate woman!"</p>

<p>He stopped before the nearest portrait, and stared
at it.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of my acquaintance with
your history?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very clever, Monsignor," answered Horace impressed.
"It is like necromancy, though I see how the trick is
done."</p>

<p>"Precisely. It is my own story. It is the story of
thousands of boys whom your set will not regard as
American boys, unless when they are looking for fighting
material. Everything and anything that could carry a gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the recent war was American with a vengeance. The
Boston Coriolanus kissed such an one and swore that he
must have come over in the Mayflower. But enough&mdash;I am
not holding a brief for anybody. The description I have
just given you of your life and mine is also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment&mdash;pardon me," said Horace, "how
did you know I was married?"</p>

<p>"And happy?" said Monsignor. "Well, that was easy.
When we were talking to-night at tea about the hanging
of Howard Tims, what disgust in your tone when you
cried out, there should be no pity for the wretch that kills
his wife."</p>

<p>"And there should not."</p>

<p>"Of course. But I knew Tims. I met him for an
hour, and I did not feel like hanging him."</p>

<p>"You are a celibate."</p>

<p>"Therefore unprejudiced. But he was condemned by
a jury of unmarried men. A clever fellow he is, and yet
he made some curious blunders in his attempt to escape
the other night. I would like to have helped him. I
have a theory of disappearing from the sight of men,
which would help the desperate much. This Tims was a
lad of your own appearance, disposition, history even. I
had a feeling that he ought not to die. What a pity we are
too wise to yield always to our feelings."</p>

<p>"But about your theory, Monsignor?" said Horace. "A
theory of disappearing?"</p>

<p>"A few nights ago some friends of mine were discussing
the possible methods by which such a man as Tims
might make his escape sure. You know that the influences
at his command were great, and tremendous efforts
were made to spare his family the disgrace of the gallows.
The officers of the law were quite determined that he
should not escape. If he had escaped, the pursuit would
have been relentless and able. He would have been
caught. And as I maintained, simply because he would
never think of using his slight acquaintance with me.
You smile at that. So did my friends. I have been
reading up the escapes of famous criminals&mdash;it is quite a
literature. I learned therein one thing: that they were
all caught again because they could not give up connection
with their past: with the people, the scenes, the
habits to which they had been accustomed. So they left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a little path from their hiding-place to the past, and the
clever detectives always found it. Thinking over this
matter I discovered that there is an art of disappearing, a
real art, which many have used to advantage. The principle
by which this art may be formulated is simple: the
person disappearing must cut himself off from his past
as completely as if he had been secretly drowned in mid-ocean."</p>

<p>"They all seem to do that," said Horace, "and yet they
are caught as easily as rats with traps and cheese."</p>

<p>"I see you think this art means running away to Brazil
in a wig and blue spectacles, as they do in a play. Let me
show some of the consequences a poor devil takes upon
himself who follows the art like an artist. He must escape,
not only from his pursuers&mdash;that's easy&mdash;but
from his friends&mdash;not so easy&mdash;and chiefly from himself&mdash;there's
the rub. He who flies from the relentless pursuit
of the law must practically die. He must change
his country, never meet friend or relative again, get a
new language, a new trade, a new place in society; in
fact a new past, peopled with parents and relatives, a new
habit of body and life, a new appearance; the color of hair,
eyes, skin must be changed; and he must eat and drink,
walk, sleep, think, and speak differently. He must become
another man almost as if he had changed his nature
for another's."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Horace, interested; "but the
theory is impossible. No one could do that even if they
desired."</p>

<p>"Tims would have desired it and accomplished it had
I thought of suggesting it to him. Here is what would
have happened. He escapes from the prison, which is
easy enough, and comes straight to me. We never met
but once. Therefore not a man in the world would have
thought of looking for him at my house. A week later
he is transferred to the house of Judy Trainor, who has
been expecting a sick son from California, a boy who disappeared
ten years previous and is probably dead. I arrange
her expectation, and the neighbors are invited to
rejoice with her over the finding of her son. He spends a
month or two in the house recovering from his illness, and
when he appears in public he knows as much about the past
of Tommy Trainor as Tommy ever knew. He is wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>comed
by his old friends. They recognize him from his
resemblance to his father, old Micky Trainor. He slips
into his position comfortably, and in five years the whole
neighborhood would go to court and swear Tims into a
lunatic asylum if he ever tried to resume his own personality."</p>

<p>The two men set up a shout at this sound conclusion.</p>

<p>"After all, there are consequences as dark as the gallows,"
said Horace.</p>

<p>"For instance," said the priest with a wave of his
hand, "sleeping under the eyes of these painted ghosts."</p>

<p>"Poor Tim Hurley," said Horace, "little he thought
he'd be a ghost to-night."</p>

<p>"He's not to be regretted," replied the other, "except
for the heart that suffers by his absence. He is with
God. Death is the one moment of our career when we
throw ourselves absolutely into the arms of God."</p>

<p>The two were getting ready to slip between the sheets
of the pompous colonial bed, when Horace began to laugh
softly to himself. He kept up the chuckling until they
were lying side by side in the darkened room.</p>

<p>"I am sure, I have a share in that chuckle," said Monsignor.</p>

<p>"Shades of my ancestors," murmured Horace, "forgive
this insult to your pious memory&mdash;that I should occupy
one bed with an idolatrous priest."</p>

<p>"They have got over all that. In eternity there is no
bigotry. But what a pity that two fine boys like us
should be kept apart by that awful spirit which prompts
men to hate one another for the love of God, and to lie
like slaves for the pure love of truth."</p>

<p>"I am cured," said Horace, placing his hand on the
Monsignor's arm. "I shall never again overlook the
human in a man. Let me thank you, Monsignor, for
this opening of my eyes. I shall never forget it. This
night has been Arabian in its enchantment. I don't like
the idea of to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No more do I. Life is tiresome in a way. For me
it is an everlasting job of beating the air with truth, because
others beat it with lies. We can't help but rejoice
when the time comes to breathe the eternal airs, where
nothing but truth can live."</p>

<p>Horace sighed, and fell asleep thinking of Sonia rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
than the delights of eternity. The priest slept as soundly.
No protest against this charming and manly companionship
stirred the silence of the room. The ghosts of the
portraits did not disturb the bold cricket of the window-sill.
He chirped proudly, pausing now and then to catch
the breathing of the sleepers, and to interpret their unconscious
movings. The trained and spiritual ear might
have caught the faint sighs and velvet footsteps of long-departed
souls, or interpreted them out of the sighing
and whispering of the leaves outside the window, and the
tread of nervous mice in the fireplace. The dawn came
and lighted up the faces of the men, faces rising out of
the heavy dark like a revelation of another world; the
veil of melancholy, which Sleep borrows from its brother
Death, resting on the head which Sonia loved, and deepening
the shadows on the serious countenance of the
priest. They lay there like brothers of the same womb,
and one might fancy the great mother Eve stealing in between
the two lights of dawn and day to kiss and bless
her just-united children.</p>

<p>When they were parting after breakfast, Monsignor
said gayly.</p>

<p>"If at any time you wish to disappear, command me."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I would rather you had to do the act,
that I might see you carry out your theory. Where do
you go now?"</p>

<p>"To tell Tim Hurley's mother he's dead, and thus
break her heart," he replied sadly, "and then to mend it
by telling her how like a saint he died."</p>

<p>"Add to that," said Horace, with a sudden rush of
tears, which for his life he could not explain, "the comfort
of a sure support from me for the rest of her life."</p>

<p>They clasped hands with feeling, and their eyes expressed
the same thought and resolution to meet again.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ABYSSES OF PAIN.</h3>


<p>Horace Endicott, though not a youth of deep sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
had capacities in that direction. Life so far
had been chiefly of the surface for him. Happiness had
hidden the deep and dangerous meanings of things. He
was a child yet in his unconcern for the future, and the
child, alone of mortals, enjoys a foretaste of immortality,
in his belief that happiness is everlasting. The shadow
of death clouding the pinched face of Tim Hurley was his
first glimpse of the real. He had not seen his father and
mother die. The thought that followed, Sonia's beloved
face lying under that shadow, had terrified him. It was
the uplifting of the veil of illusion that enwraps childhood.
The thought stayed his foot that night as he
turned into the avenue leading up to his own house, and
he paused to consider this new dread.</p>

<p>The old colonial house greeted his eyes, solemn and
sweet in the moonlight, with a few lights of human comfort
in its windows. He had never thought so before,
but now it came straight to his heart that this was his
home, his old friend, steadfast and unchanging, which
had welcomed him into the world, and had never changed
its look to him, never closed its doors against him; all
that remained of the dear, but almost forgotten past; the
beautiful stage from which all the ancient actors had
made irrevocable exit. What beauty had graced it for a
century back! What honors its children had brought to
it from councils of state and of war! What true human
worth had sanctified it! Last and the least of the splendid
throng, he felt his own unworthiness sadly; but he
was young yet, only a boy, and he said to himself that
Sonia had crowned the glory of the old house with her
beauty, her innocence, her devoted love. In making her
its mistress he had not wronged its former rulers, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
broken the traditions of beauty. He stood a long time
looking at the old place, wondering at the charm which
it had so suddenly flung upon him. Then he shook off
the new and weird feeling and flew to embrace his Sonia
of the starry eyes.</p>

<p>Alas, poor boy! He stood for a moment on the threshold.
He could hear the faint voices of servants, the
shutting of distant doors, and a hundred sweet sounds
within; and around him lay the calmness of the night,
with a drowsy moon overhead lolling on lazy clouds.
Nothing warned him that he stood on the threshold of
pain. No instinct hinted at the horror within. The
house that sheltered his holy mother and received her last
breath, that covered for a few hours the body of his heroic
father, the house of so many honorable memories, had
become the habitation of sinners, whose shame was to be
everlasting. He stole in on tiptoe, with love stirring his
young pulses. For thirty minutes there was no break in
the silence. Then he came out as he entered, on tiptoe,
and no one knew that he had seen with his own eyes into
the deeps of hell. For thirty minutes, that seemed to
have the power of as many centuries, he had looked on
sin, shame, disgrace, with what seemed to be the eyes of
God; so did the horror shock eye and heart, yet leave
him sight and life to look again and again.</p>

<p>In that time he tasted with his own lips the bitterness
which makes the most wretched death sweeter by comparison
than bread and honey to the hungry. At the end
of it, when he stole away a madman, he felt within his
own soul the cracking and upheaving of some immensity,
and saw or felt the opening of abysses from which rose
fearful exhalations of crime, shapes of corruption, things
without shape that provoked to rage, pain and madness.
He was not without cunning, since he closed the doors
softly, stole away in the shadows of the house and the
avenue, and escaped to a distant wood unseen. From his
withered face all feeling except horror had faded. Once
deep in the wood, he fell under the trees like an epileptic,
turned on his face, and dug the earth with hands and
feet and face in convulsions of pain.</p>

<p>The frightened wood-life, sleeping or waking, fled from
the great creature in its agony. In the darkness he
seemed some monster, which in dreadful silence, writhed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and fought down a slow road to death. He was hardly
conscious of his own behavior, poor innocent, crushed
by the sins of others. He lived, and every moment was a
dying. He gasped as with the last breath, yet each breath
came back with new torture. He shivered to the root of
nature, like one struck fatally, and the convulsion revived
life and thought and horror. After long hours a dreadful
sleep bound his senses, and he lay still, face downward,
arms outstretched, breathing like a child, a pitiful sight.
Death must indeed be a binding thing, that father and
mother did not leave the grave to soothe and strengthen
their wretched son. He lay there on his face till dawn.
The crowing of the cock, which once warned Peter of his
shame, waked him. He turned over, stared at the
branches above, sat up puzzled, and showed his face to
the dim light. His arms gathered in his knees, and he
made an effort to recollect himself. But no one would
have mistaken that sorrowful, questioning face; it was
Adam looking toward the lost Eden with his arms about
the dead body of his son. A desolate and unconscious
face, wretched and vacant as a lone shore strewn with
wreckage.</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet after a time, wondering at his
weakness. The effort roused and steadied him, his mind
cleared as he walked to the edge of the wood and stared
at the old house, which now in the mist of morning had
the fixed, still, reproachful look of the dead. As if a
spirit had leaped upon him, memory brought back his
personality and his grief together. Men told afterwards,
early laborers in the fields, of a cry from the Endicott
woods, so strange and woful that their hearts beat fast
and their frightened ears strained for its repetition.
Sonia heard it in her adulterous dreams. It was not repeated.
The very horror of it terrified the man who
uttered it. He stood by a tree trembling, for a double
terror fell upon him, terror of her no less than of himself.
He staggered through the woods, and sought far-away
places in the hills, where none might see him. When
the sun drifted in through dark boughs he cursed it, the
emblem of joy. The singing of the birds sounded to his
ears like the shriek of madmen. When he could think
and reason somewhat, he called up the vision of Sonia to
wonder over it. The childlike eyes, the beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
lovable face, the modest glance, the innocent blushes&mdash;had
nature such masks for her vilest offspring? The
mere animal senses should have recognized at the first
this deadly thing, as animals recognize their foes; and he
had lived with the viper, believing her the peer of his
spotless mother. She was his wife! Even at that moment
the passionate love of yesterday stirred in his veins
and moved him to deeper horror.</p>

<p>He doubted that he was Horace Endicott. Every one
knew that boy to be the sanest of young men, husband to
the loveliest of women, a happy, careless, wealthy fellow,
almost beside himself with the joy of life. The madman
who ran about the desolate wilds uttering strange and
terrible things, who was wrapped within and without in
torments of flame, who refrained from crime and death
only because vengeance would thus be cheaply satisfied,
could hardly be the boy of yesterday. Was sin such a
magician that in a day it could evolve out of merry Horace
and innocent Sonia two such wretches? The wretch
Sonia had proved her capacity for evil; the wretch
Horace felt his capabilities for crime and rejoiced in
them. He must live to punish. A sudden fear came
upon him that his grief and rage might bring death or
madness, and leave him incapable of vengeance. <i>They</i>
would wish nothing better. No, he must live, and think
rationally, and not give way. But the mind worked on
in spite of the will. It sat like Penelope over the loom,
weaving terrible fancies in blood and flame! the days that
had been, the days that were passing; the scenes of love
and marriage; the old house and its latest sinners; and
the days that were to come, crimson-dyed, shameful; the
dreadful loom worked as if by enchantment, scene following
scene, the web endless, and the woven stuff flying
into the sky like smoke from a flying engine, darkening
all the blue.</p>

<p>The days and nights passed while he wandered about in
the open air. Hunger assailed him, distances wearied
him, he did not sleep; but these hardships rather cooled
the inward fire, and did not harm him. One day he
came to a pool, clear as a spring to its sandy bottom,
embowered in trees, except on one side where the sun
shone. He took off his clothes and plunged in. The
waters closed over him sweet and cool as the embrace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
death. The loom ceased its working a while, and the
thought rose up, is vengeance worth the trouble? He
sank to the sandy bed, and oh, it was restful! A grip
on a root held him there, and a song of his boyhood
soothed his ears until it died away in heavenly music, far
off, enticing, welcoming him to happier shores. He had
found all at once forgetfulness and happiness, and he
would remain. Then his grip loosened, and he came to
the surface, swimming mechanically about, debating with
himself another descent into the enchanted region beneath.</p>

<p>Some happy change had touched him. He felt the
velvety waters grasp his body and rejoiced in it; the little
waves which he sent to the reedy bank made him smile
with their huddling and back-rushing and laughing; he
held up his arm as he swam to see the sun flash through
the drops of water from his hand. What a sweet bed
of death! No hard-eyed nurses and physicians with their
array of bottles, no hypocrites snuffling sympathy while
dreaming of fat legacies, no pious mummeries, only the innocent
things direct from the hand of God, unstained by
human sin and training, trees and bushes and flowers, the
tender living things about, the voiceless and passionless
music of lonely nature, the hearty sun, and the maternal
embrace of the sweet waters. It was dying as the wild
animals die, without ceremony; as the flowers die, a
gentle weakening of the stem, a rush of perfume to the
soft earth, and the caressing winds to do the rest. Yes,
down to the bottom again! Who would have looked for
so pleasant a door to death in that lonely and lovely pool!</p>

<p>He slipped his foot under the root so that it would hold
him if he struggled, put his arms under his head like one
about to sleep, and yielded his senses to that far-off, divine
music, enticing, welcoming.... It ceased, but not until
he had forgotten all his sorrows and was speeding toward
death. Sorrow rescued sorrow, and gave him back
to the torturers. The old woman who passed by the
pond that morning gathering flowers, and smiling as if
she felt the delight of a child&mdash;the smile of a child
on the mask of grief-worn age&mdash;saw his clothes and
then his body floating upward helpless from the bottom.
She seized his arm, and pulled him up on the low bank.
He gasped a little and was able to thank her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I hadn't come along just then," she said placidly,
as she covered him decently with his coat, "you'd have
been drownded. Took a cramp, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"All I remember is taking a swim and sinking, mother.
I am very much obliged to you, and can get along very
well, I think."</p>

<p>"If you want any help, just say so," she answered.
"When you get dressed my house is a mile up the road,
and the road is a mile from here. I can give you a cup
of tea or warm milk, and welcome."</p>

<p>"I'll go after a while," said he, "and then I'll be able
to thank you still better for a very great service, mother."</p>

<p>She smiled at the affectionate title, and went her way.
He became weak all at once, and for a while could not
dress. The long bath had soothed his mind, and now
distressed nature could make her wants known. Hunger,
soreness of body, drowsiness, attacked him together. He
found it pleasant to lie there and look at the sun, and
feel too happy to curse it as before. The loom had done
working, Penelope was asleep. The door seemed forever
shut on the woman known as Sonia, who had tormented
him long ago. The dead should trouble no one living.
He was utterly weary, sore in every spot, crushed by torment
as poor Tim Hurley had been broken by his engine.
This recollection, and his lying beside the pool as Tim
lay beside the running river, recalled the Monsignor and
the holy oils. As he fell asleep the fancy struck him that
his need at that moment was the holy oils; some balm for
sick eyes and ears, for tired hands and soiled feet, like
his mother's kisses long ago, that would soothe the aching,
and steal from the limbs into the heart afterwards; a
heavenly dew that would aid sleep in restoring the stiffened
sinews and distracted nerves. The old woman came back
to him later, and found him in his sleep of exhaustion.
Like a mother, she pillowed his head, covered him with
his clothes, and her own shawl, and made sure that his
rest would be safe and comfortable. She studied the
noble young head, and smoothed it tenderly. The pitiful
face, a terrible face for those who could read, so bitterly
had grief written age on the curved dimpled surface of
youth, stirred some convulsion in her, for she threw up
her arms in despair as she walked away homeward, and
wild sobs choked her for minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat on the kitchen porch of her poor home that
afternoon, quite free from pain. A wonderful relief had
come to him. He seemed lifted into an upper region of
peace like one just returned from infernal levels. The
golden air tasted like old wine. The scenes about him
were marvelous to his eyes. His own personality redeemed
from recent horror became a delightful thing.</p>

<p>"It is terrible to suffer," he said to Martha Willis.
"In the last five days I have suffered."</p>

<p>"As all men must suffer," said the woman resignedly.</p>

<p>"Then you have suffered too? How did you ever get
over it, mother?"</p>

<p>She did not tell him, after a look at his face, that some
sorrows are indelible.</p>

<p>"We have to get over everything, son. And it is lucky
we can do it, without running into an insane asylum."</p>

<p>"Were your troubles very great, mother?"</p>

<p>"Lots of people about say I deserved them, so they
couldn't be very great," she answered, and he laughed at
her queer way of putting it, then checked himself.</p>

<p>"Sorrow is sorrow to him who suffers," he said, "no
matter what people say about it. And I would not wish
a beast to endure what I did. I would help the poor
devil who suffered, no matter how much he deserved his
pain."</p>

<p>"Only those who suffered feel that way. I am alone
now, but this house was crowded thirty years ago. There
was Lucy, and John, and Oliver, and Henry, and my
husband, and we were very happy."</p>

<p>"And they are all gone?"</p>

<p>"I shall never see them again here. Lucy died when
I needed her most, and Henry, such a fine boy, followed
her before he was twenty. They are safe in the churchyard,
and that makes me happy, for they are mine still,
they will always be mine. John was like his father, and
both were drunkards. They beat me in turn, and I was
glad when they took to tramping. They're tramping
yet, as I hear, but I haven't seen them in years. And
Oliver, the cleverest boy in the school, and very headstrong,
he went to Boston, and from there he went to jail
for cheating a bank, and in jail he died. It was best for
him and for me. I took him back to lie beside his brother
and sister, though some said it was a shame. But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
can a mother do? Her children are hers no matter if
they turn out wrong."</p>

<p>"And you lived through it all, mother?" said the
listener with his face working.</p>

<p>"Once I thought different, but now I know it was for
the best," she answered calmly, and chiefly for his benefit.
"I had my days and years even, when I thought
some other woman had taken Martha Willis' place, a poor
miserable creature, more like the dead than the live.
But I often thought, since my own self came back, how
lucky it was Lucy had her mother to close her eyes, and
the same for poor Henry. And Oliver, he was pretty
miserable dying in jail, but I never forgot what he said to
me. 'Mother,' he said, 'it's like dying at home to have you
with me here.' He was very proud, and it cut him that
the cleverest of the family should die in jail. And he
said, 'you'll put me beside the others, and take care of the
grave, and not be ashamed of me, mother.' It was the
money he left me, that kept this house and me ever since.
Now just think of the way he'd have died if I had not
been about to see to him. And I suppose the two
tramps'll come marching in some day to die, or to be
buried, and they'll be lucky to find me living. But anyway
I've arranged it with the minister to see to them, and
give them a place with their own, if I'm not here to look
after them."</p>

<p>"And you lived through it all!" repeated Horace in
wonder.</p>

<p>Her story gave him hope. He must put off thinking
until grief had loosened its grip on his nerves, and the
old self had come uppermost. He was determined that
the old self should return, as Martha had proved it could
return. He enjoyed its presence at that very moment,
though with a dread of its impending departure. The
old woman readily accepted him as a boarder for a few
days or longer, and treated him like a son. He slept
that night in a bed, the bed of Oliver and Henry,&mdash;their
portraits hanging over the bureau&mdash;and slept as
deeply as a wearied child. A blessed sleep was followed
by a bitter waking. Something gripped him the moment
he rose and looked out at the summer sun; a cruel hand
seized his breast, and weighted it with vague pain. Deep
sighs shook him, and the loom of Penelope began its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dreadful weaving of bloody visions, while the restful pool
in the woods tempted him to its cool rest. For a moment
he gave way to the thought that all had ended for him on
earth. Then he braced himself for his fight, went down
to chat cheerfully with Martha, and ate her tasty breakfast
with relish. He saw that his manner pleased the
simple heart, the strong, heroic mother, the guardian of
so many graves.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ROAD TO NOTHINGNESS.</h3>


<p>"Whatever trouble you're a-sufferin' from," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Martha, as he was going, "I can tell you one sure thing
about it. Time changes it so's you wouldn't think it was
the same trouble a year afterwards. Now, if you wait,
and have patience, and don't do anything one way or
another for a month, you'll be real glad you waited. Once
I would have been glad to die the minute after sorrow
came. Now I'm glad I didn't die, for I've learned to see
things different somehow."</p>

<p>His heart was being gnawed at that moment by horrible
pain, but he caught the force of her words and took his
resolve against the seduction of the pool, that lay now in
his vision, as beautiful as a window of heaven.</p>

<p>"I've come to the same thought," he answered. "I'll
not do anything for a month anyway, unless it's something
very wise and good. But I'm going now to think
the matter over by myself, and I know that you have done
me great service in helping me to look at my sorrows
rightly."</p>

<p>She smiled her thanks and watched him as he struck
out for the hills two miles away. Often had her dear
sons left the door for the same walk, and she had watched
them with such love and pride. Oh, life, life!</p>

<p>By the pool which tempted him so strongly Horace sat
down to study the problem of his future.</p>

<p>"You are one solution of it," he thought, as he smiled
on its beautiful waters. "All others failing to please, you
are here, sure, definite, soft as a bed, tender as Martha,
lovely as a dream. There will be no vulgar outcry when
you untie the knot of woe. And because I am sure of you,
and have such confidence in you, I can sit here and defy
your present charm."</p>

<p>He felt indeed that he was strong again in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pain. As one in darkness, longing for the light, might
see afar the faint glint of the dawn, he had caught a
glimpse of hope in the peace which came to him in Martha's
cottage. It could come again. In its light he knew that
he could look upon the past with calmness, and feel no
terror even at the name of Sonia. He would encourage
its return. It was necessary for him to fix the present
status of the woman whom he had once called his wife. He
could reason from that point logically. She had never
been his wife except by the forms of law. Her treason
had begun with his love, and her uncleanness was part of
her nature; so much had he learned on that fearful night
which revealed her to him. His wealth and his name were
the prizes which made her traitor to lover and husband.
What folly is there in man, or what enchantment in beauty,
or what madness in love, that he could have taken to his
arms the thing that hated him and hated goodness?
Should not love, the best of God's gifts, be wisdom too?
Or do men ever really love the object of passion?</p>

<p>Oh, he had loved her! Not a doubt but that he loved
her still! Sonia, Sonia! The pool wrinkled at the sound
of her name, as he shrieked it in anguish across the
water. There was nothing in the world so beautiful as
she. Her figure rose before him more entrancing than
this fairy lake with its ever-changing loveliness. Its
shadows under the trees were in her eyes, its luster under
the sun was the luster of her body! Oh, there was nothing
of beauty in it, perfume, grace, color, its singing and
murmuring on the shore, that this perfect sinner had not
in her body!</p>

<p>He steadied himself with the thought of old Martha.
A dread caught him that the image of this foul beauty
would haunt him thus forever, and be able at any time
to drive joy out of him and madness into him. Some
part of him clung to her, and wove a thousand fancies about
her beauty. When the pain of his desolation gripped him
the result was invariable: she rose out of the mist of pain,
not like a fury, or the harpy she was, but beautiful as the
morning, far above him, with glorious eyes fixed on the
heavens. He thought it rather the vision of his lost happiness
than of her. If she were present then, he would
have held her under the water with his hands squeezing
her throat, and so doubly killed her. But what a terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
if this vision were to become permanent, and he should
never know ease or the joy of living again! And for a
thing so worthless and so foul!</p>

<p>He steadied himself again with the thought of old
Martha, and fixed his mind on the first fact, the starting-point
of his reasoning. She had never been his wife.
Her own lips had uttered that sentence. The law had
bound them, and the law protected her now. But she
enjoyed a stronger guard even: his name. It menaced him
in each solution of the problem of his future life. He
could do little without smirching that honored name. He
might take his own life. But that would be to punish
the innocent and to reward the guilty. His wealth would
become the gilding of adultery, and her joy would become
perfect in his death. Imagine him asleep in the grave,
while she laughed over his ashes, crying to herself:
always a fool. He might kill her, or him, or both; a short
punishment for a long treason, and then the trail of
viperous blood over the name of Endicott forever; not
blood but slime; not a tragedy, but the killing of rats in
a cellar; and perhaps a place for himself in a padded cell,
legally mad.</p>

<p>He might desert her, go away without explanation, and
never see her again. That would be putting the burden
of shame on his own shoulders, in exile and a branded man
for her sake. She would still have his name, his income,
her lover, her place in society, her right to explain his
absence at her pleasure. He could ruin her ruined life
by exposing her. Then would come the divorce court,
the publicity, the leer of the mob, the pointed fingers of
scorn. Impossible! Why could he not leave the matter
untouched and keep up appearances before the world?
Least endurable of any scheme. He knew that he could
never meet her again without killing her, unless this
problem was settled. When he had determined on what
he should do, he might get courage to look on her face
once more.</p>

<p>He wore the day out in vain thought, varying the dulness
by stamping about the pond, by swimming across it,
by studying its pleasant features. There was magic in it.
When he stripped off his clothes and flung them on the bank
part of his grief went with them. When he plunged into
the lovable water, not only did grief leave him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Horace Endicott returned; that Horace who once swam
a boy in such lakes, and went hilarious with the wild joy
of living. He dashed about the pool in a gay frenzy,
revelling in the sensation that tragedy had no part in his
life, that sorrow and shame had not yet once come nigh
him. The shore and the donning of his garments were
like clouds pouring themselves out on the sunlit earth.
He could hardly bear it, and hung about listlessly before
he could persuade himself to dress.</p>

<p>"Surely you are my one friend," he said to the quiet
water. "Is it that you feel certain of giving me my last
sleep, my last kiss as you steal the breath from me?
None would do it gentlier. You give me release from
pain, you alone. And you promise everlasting release.
I will remember you if it comes to that."</p>

<p>The pool looked up to him out of deep evening shadows
cast upon it by the woods. There was something human
in the variety of its expression. As if a chained soul,
silenced forever as to speech, condemned to a garment of
water, struggled to reach a human heart by infinite shades
of beauty, and endless variations of sound. The thought
woke his pity, and he looked down at the water as one looks
into the face of a suffering friend. Here were two castaways,
cut off from the highway of life, imprisoned in
circumstances as firmly as if behind prison grills. For
him there was hope, for the pool nothing. At this moment
its calm face pictured profound sadness. The black
shadow of the woods lay deep on the west bank, but its
remotest edge showed a brilliant green, where the sun
lingered on the top fringes of the foliage. Along the
east bank, among the reeds, the sun showed crimson, and
all the tender colors of the water plants faded in a glare
of blood. This savage brilliance would soon give way to
the gray mist of twilight, and then to the darkness of
night. Even this poor dumb beauty reflected in its
helplessly beautiful way the tragedies of mankind.</p>

<p>As before with the evening came peace and release from
pain. Again he sat on Martha's porch after supper, and
thought nothing so beautiful as life; and as he listened to
further details of her life-story, imparted with the wise
intention of binding him to life more securely, he felt
that all was not yet lost for him. In his little room while
the night was still young, he opened an old volume at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
play of Hamlet and read the story through. Surely he had
never read this play before? He recalled vaguely that it
had been studied in college, that some great actor had
played it for him, that he had believed it a wonderful
thing; memories now less real than dreams. For in
reading it this night he entered into the very soul of
Hamlet, lived his tortures over again, wept and raved in
dumb show with the wretched prince, and flung himself
and his book to the floor in grief at the pitiful ending.
He was the Hamlet; youth with a problem of the horrible;
called to solve that which shook the brains of statesmen;
dying in utter failure with that most pathetic dread of a
wounded name.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 34%">
<div class="poem">
Oh, good Horatio, what a wounded name.<br />
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.<br />
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br />
Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br />
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br />
To tell my story.<br />
</div></div>

<p>For a little he had thought there could not be in
the world such suffering as his; how clear now that
his peculiar sorrow was strange to no hour of unfortunate
time; an old story, innocence and virtue&mdash;God
knew he had no pride in his own virtue&mdash;preyed upon
by cunning vice. He read Hamlet again. Oh, what
depth of anguish! What a portrayal of grief and
madness! Horace shook with the sobs that nearly choked
him. Like the sleek murderer and his plump queen, the
two creatures hatefulest to him lived their meanly prosperous
lives on his bounty. What conscience flamed so
dimly in the Danish prince that he could hesitate
before his opportunity? Long ago, had Horace been in
his place, the guilty pair would have paid in blood for
their lust and ambition. Hamlet would not kill himself
because the Almighty had "fixed his canon 'gainst self-slaughter;"
or because in the sleep of death might rise
strange dreams; he would not kill his uncle because he
caught him praying; and he was content with preaching
to his mother. Conscience! God! The two words
had not reached his heart or mind once since that awful
night. No scruples of the Lord Hamlet obscured his view
or delayed his action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been brought up to a vague respect of religious
things. He had even wondered where his father and
mother might now inhabit, as one might wonder of
the sea-drowned where their bodies might be floating;
but no nearer than this had heaven come to him. He had
never felt any special influence of religion in his life. In
what circumstances had Hamlet been brought up, that
religious feeling should have so serious an effect upon him?
Doubtless the prince had been a Catholic like his recent
acquaintance the Monsignor. Ah, he had forgotten that
interesting man, who had told him much worth remembrance.
In particular his last words ... what were those
last words? The effort to remember gave him mixed
dreams of Hamlet and the Monsignor that night.</p>

<p>In the morning he went off to the pool with the book of
Hamlet and the echo of those important but forgotten
words. The lonely water seemed to welcome him when
he emerged from the path through the woods; the underbrush
rustled, living things scurried away into bush and
wave, the weeds on the far bank set up a rustling, and
little waves leaped on the shore. He smiled as if getting
a friend's morning salute, and began to talk aloud.</p>

<p>"I have brought you another unfortunate," he said,
"and I am going to read his thoughts to you."</p>

<p>He opened the book and very tenderly, as if reciting a
funeral service, murmured the words of the soliloquy on
suicide. How solemnly sounded in that solitude the
fateful phrase "but that the dread of something after
death!" That was indeed the rub! After death there
can be anything; and were it little and slender as a spider's
web, it might be too much for the sleep that is supposed
to know no waking and no dreams. After all, he thought,
how much are men alike; for the quandary of Hamlet
is mine; I know not what to do. He laid aside the book
and gave himself to idle watching of the pool. A bird
dipped his wing into it midway, and set a circle of
wavelets tripping to the shore. One by one they died
among the sedges, and there was no trace of them more.</p>

<p>"That is the thing for which I am looking," he said;
"disappearance without consequences ... just to fade
away as if into water or air ... to separate on the spot
into original elements ... to be no more what I am,
either to myself or others ... then no inquest, no search,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
no funeral, no tears ... nothing. And after such a
death, perhaps, something might renew the personality in
conditions so far from these, so different, that <i>now</i> and
<i>then</i> would never come into contact."</p>

<p>He sighed. What a disappearance that would be. And
at that moment the words of the Monsignor came back to
him:</p>

<p>"<i>If at any time you wish to disappear, command me.</i>"</p>

<p>A thrill leaped through his dead veins, as of one rising
from the dead, but he lay motionless observing the pool.
Before him passed the details of that night at the tavern;
the portraits, the chirping cricket, the vines at the window,
the strange theory of the priest about disappearing. He
reviewed that theory as a judge might review a case, so
he thought; but in fact his mind was swinging at headlong
speed over the possibilities, and his pulses were
bounding. It was possible, even in this world, to disappear
more thoroughly behind the veil of life than under
the veil of death. If one only had the will!</p>

<p>He rose brimming with exultant joy. An intoxication
seized him that lifted him at once over all his sorrow, and
placed him almost in that very spot wherein he stood ten
days ago; gay, debonair, light of heart as a boy, untouched
by grief or the dread of grief. It was a divine madness.
He threw off his clothes, admired his shapely body for a
moment as he poised on the bank, and flung himself in
headlong with a shout. He felt as he slipped through the
water but he did not utter the thought, that if this intoxication
did not last he would never leave the pool. It
endured and increased. He swam about like a demented
fish. On that far shore where the reeds grew he paddled
through the mud and thrust his head among the sedges
kissing them with laughter. In another place he reached
up to the high bank and pulled out a bunch of ferns which
he carried about with him. He roamed about the sandy
bottom in one corner, and thrust his nose and his hands
into it, laying his cheek on the smooth surface. He
swallowed mouthfuls of the cool water, and felt that he
tasted joy for the first time. He tired his body with
divings, racings, leapings, and shouting.</p>

<p>When he leaped ashore and flung himself in the shade
of the wood, the intoxication had increased. So, not for
nothing had he met the priest. That encounter, the delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the journey, the stay in the village, the peculiar character
of the man, his odd theory, were like elements of an
antidote, compounded to meet that venom which the
vicious had injected into his life. Wonderful! He
looked at the open book beside him, and then rose to his
knees, with the water dripping from his limbs. In a loud
voice he made a profession of faith.</p>

<p>"I believe in God forever."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE DOOR IS CLOSED.</h3>


<p>Even Martha was startled by the change in him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had hoped and prayed for it, but had not looked for it so
soon, and did not expect blithe spirits after such despair.
In deep joy he poured out his soul to her all the evening,
but never mentioned deeds or names in his tragedy.
Martha hardly thought of them. She knew from the first
that this man's soul had been nearly wrecked by some
shocking deviltry, and that the best medicine for him was
complete forgetfulness. Horace felt as a life-prisoner,
suddenly set free from the loathsomest dungeon in Turkestan,
might feel on greeting again the day and life's sweet
activities. The first thought which surged in upon him
was the glory of that life which had been his up to the
moment when sorrow engulfed him.</p>

<p>"My God," he cried to Martha, "is it possible that men
can hold such a treasure, and prize it as lightly as I did
once."</p>

<p>He had thought almost nothing of it, had been glad to
get rid of each period as it passed, and of many persons
and scenes connected with childhood, youth, and manhood.
Now they looked to him, these despised years, persons,
and scenes, like jewels set in fine gold, priceless
jewels of human love fixed forever in the adamant of God's
memory. They were his no more. Happily God would
not forget them, but would treasure them, and reward
time and place and human love according to their deserving.
He was full of scorn for himself, who could take and
enjoy so much of happiness with no thought of its value,
and no other acknowledgment than the formal and hasty
word of thanks, as each soul laid its offering of love and
service at his feet.</p>

<p>"You're no worse than the rest of us," said Martha,
"I didn't know, and very few of my friends ever seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to know, what good things they had till they lost 'em. It
may be that God would not have us put too high a price
on 'em at first, fearin' we'd get selfish about 'em. Then
when they're gone, it turns our thoughts more to heaven,
which is the only place where we have any chance to get
'em back."</p>

<p>When he had got over his self-scorn, the abyss of pain
and horror out of which God had lifted him&mdash;this
was his belief&mdash;showed itself mighty and terrible to his
normal vision. Never would he have believed that a man
could fall so far and so awfully, had he not been in those
dark depths and mounted to the sun again. He had read
of such pits as exaggerations. He had seen sorrow and
always thought its expression too fantastic for reality.
Looking down now into the noisome tunnel of his own
tragedy, he could only wonder that its wretched walls and
exit did not carry the red current of blood mingled with
its own foul streaks. Nothing that he had done in his
grief expressed more than a syllable of the pain he had
endured. The only full voice to such grief would have
been the wrecking of the world. Strange that he could
now look calmly into this abyss, without the temptation to
go mad. But its very ghastliness turned his thought into
another channel. The woman who had led him into the
pit, what of her? Free from the tyranny of her beauty,
he saw her with all her loveliness, merely the witch of the
abyss, the flower and fruit of that loathsome depth, in
whose bosom filthy things took their natural shape of
horror, and put on beauty only to entrap the innocent of
the upper world. Yes, he was entirely freed from her.
Her name sounded to his ears like a name from hell, but
it brought no paleness to his cheeks, no shock to his nerves,
no stirring of his pulses. The loom of Penelope was
broken, and forever, he hoped.</p>

<p>"I am free," he said to Martha the next morning, after
he had tested himself in various ways. "The one devil
that remained with me is gone, and I feel sure she will
never trouble me again."</p>

<p>"It is good to be free," said Martha, "if the thing is
evil. I am free from all that worried me most. I am
free from the old fear of death. But sometimes I get sad
thinking how little we need those we thought we could
not do without."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"How true that sounds, mother. There is a pity in
it. We are not necessary to one another, though we think
so. Every one we love dies, we lose all things as time goes
on, and when we come to old age nothing remains of
the past; but just the same we enjoy what we have, and
forget what we had. There is one thing necessary, and
that is true life."</p>

<p>"And where can we get that?" said Martha.</p>

<p>"Only from God, I think," he replied.</p>

<p>She smiled her satisfaction with his thought, and he
went off to the pool for the last time, singing in his heart
with joy. He would have raised his voice too, but, feeling
himself in the presence of a stupendous thing, he refrained
out of reverence. If suffering Hamlet had only
encountered the idea of disappearing, his whole life would
have been set right in a twinkling of the eye. The Dane
had an inkling of the solution of his problem when in
anguish he cried out,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>But he had not followed his thought to its natural consequence,
seeing only death at the end of reasoning.
Horace saw disappearance, and he had now to consider
the idea of complete disappearance with all its effects upon
him and others. What would be the effect upon himself?
He would vanish into thin air as far as others were concerned.
Whatever of his past the present held would turn
into ashes. There would be no further connection with it.
An impassable void would be created across which neither
he nor those he loved could go. He went over in his
mind what he had to give up, and trembled before his
chum and his father's sister, two souls that loved him.
Death would not be more terrible. For him, no; but
for them? Death would leave them his last word, look,
sigh, his ashes, his resting-place; disappearance would
rob them of all knowledge, and clothe his exit with everlasting
sadness. There was no help for it. Many souls
more loving suffered a similar anguish, and survived it.
It astonished and even appalled him, if anything could
now appal him, that only two out of the group of his
close friends and near acquaintances seemed near enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in affection and intimacy to mourn his loss. Not one of
twenty others would lose a dinner or a fraction of appetite
because he had vanished so pitifully. How rarer than
diamonds is that jewel of friendship!</p>

<p>He had thought once that a hundred friends would
have wept bitter tears over his sorrow; of the number
there were left only two!</p>

<p>It was easy for him to leave the old life, now become
so hateful; but there was terror in putting on the new,
to which he must ally himself as if born into it, like a
tree uprooted from its native soil and planted far from its
congenial elements in the secret, dark, sympathetic places
of the earth. He must cut himself off more thoroughly
than by death. The disappearance must be eternal, unless
death removed Sonia Westfield before circumstances
made return practically impossible; his experience of life
showed that disagreeable people rarely die while the
microbe of disagreeableness thrives in them.</p>

<p>What would be the effect of his disappearance on
Sonia and her lover? The question brought a smile to his
wan face. She had married his name and his money,
and would lose both advantages. He would take his property
into exile to the last penny. His name without his
income would be a burden to her. His disappearance
would cast upon her a reproach, unspoken, unseen, a
mere mist enwrapping her fatally, but not to be dispelled.
Her mouth would be shut tight; no chance for innuendoes,
lest hint might add suspicion to mystery. She would be
forced to observe the proprieties to the letter, and the
law would not grant her a divorce for years. In time she
would learn that her only income was the modest revenue
from her own small estate; that he had taken all with
him into darkness; and still she would not dare to tell
the damaging fact to her friends. She would be forced
to keep up appearances, to spend money in a vain search
for him, or his wealth; suspecting much yet knowing
nothing, miserably certain that he was living somewhere
in luxury, and enjoying his vengeance.</p>

<p>He no longer thought of vengeance. He did not desire
it. The mills of the gods grind out vengeance enough to
glut any appetite. By the mere exercise of his right to
disappear he gave the gods many lashes with which to
arm the furies against her. He was satisfied with being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
beyond her reach forever. Now that he knew just what
to do, now that with his plan had come release from depression,
now that he was himself again almost, he felt
that he could meet Sonia Westfield and act the part of a
busy husband without being tempted to strangle her. In
her very presence he would put in motion the machinery
which would strip her of luxury and himself of his present
place in the world.</p>

<p>The process took about two months. The first step was
a visit to Monsignor O'Donnell, a single visit, and the
first result was a single letter, promptly committed to the
flames. Then he went home with a story of illness, of a
business enterprise which had won his fancy, of necessary
visits to the far west; which were all true, but not in the
sense in which Sonia took these details. They not only
explained his absence, but also excused the oddity of his
present behavior. He hardly knew how he behaved with
her. He did not act, nor lose self-confidence. He had
no desire to harm her. He was simply indifferent, as if
from sickness. As the circumstances fell in with her inclinations,
though she could not help noticing his new
habits and peculiarities, she made no protest and very
little comment. He saw her rarely, and in time carried
himself with a sardonic good humor as surprising to him
as inexplicable to her. She seemed as far from him as if
she had suddenly turned Eskimo. Once or twice a sense
of loathing invaded him, a flame of hatred blazed up, soon
suppressed. He was complete master of himself, and his
reward was that he could be her judge, with the indifference
of a dignitary of the law. The disposal of his
property was accomplished with perfect secrecy, his wife
consenting on the plea of a better investment.</p>

<p>So the two months came to an end in peace, and he
stood at last before that door which he himself had opened
into the new future. Once closed no other hand but his
could open it. A time might come when even to his hand
the hinge would not respond. Two persons knew his
secret in part, the Monsignor and a woman; but they
knew nothing more than that he did not belong to them
from the beginning, and more than that they would never
know, if he carried out his plan of disappearance perfectly.
Whatever the result, he felt now that the crisis of his life
had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last moment, however, doubts worried him about
thus cutting himself off from his past so utterly, and
adopting another personality. Some deep-lying repugnance
stirred him against the double process. Would it
not be better to live under his own name in remote countries,
and thus be ready, if fate allowed, to return home
at the proper time? Perhaps. In that case he must be
prepared for her pursuit, her letters, her chicanery, which
he could not bear. Her safety and his own, if the stain
of blood was to be kept off the name of Endicott, demanded
the absolute cessation of all relationship between them.
Yet that did not contain the whole reason. Lurking
somewhere in those dark depths of the soul, where the
lead never penetrates, he found the thought of vengeance.
After all he did wish to punish her and to see her punishment.
He had thought to leave all to the gods, but
feared the gods would not do all their duty. If they
needed spurring, he would be near to provide new whips
and fresher scorpions. He shook off hesitation when the
last day of his old life came, and made his farewells with
decision. A letter to his aunt and to his friend, bidding
each find no wonder and no worry about him in the events
of the next month, and lose no time in searching for
him; a quiet talk with old Martha on her little verandah;
a visit to the pool on a soft August night; and an evening
spent alone in his father's house; these were his leave-takings.</p>

<p>They would never find a place in his life again, and he
would never dare to return to them; since the return of
the criminal over the path by which he escaped into
secrecy gave him into the hands of his pursuers. The old
house had become the property of strangers. The offset
to this grief was the fact that Sonia would never dishonor
it again with her presence. Just now dabbling in her
sins down by the summer sea, she was probably reading
the letter which he had sent her about business in Wisconsin.
Later a second letter would bear her the sentence of
a living death. The upright judge had made her the
executioner. What a long tragedy that would be! He
thought of it as he wandered about the lovely rooms of
his old home; what long days of doubt before certainty
would come; what horror when bit by bit the scheme of
his vengeance unfolded: what vain, bitter, furious strug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>gling
to find and devour him; and then the miserable ending
when time had proved his disappearance absolute and
perfect!</p>

<p>At midnight, after a pilgrimage to every loved spot in
the household shrine, he slipped away unseen and struck
out on foot over the fields for a distant railway station.
For two months he lived here and there in California,
while his beard grew and his thoughts devoured him.
Then one evening he stepped somewhat feebly from the
train in New York, crawled into a cab, and drove to
No. 127 Mulberry Street. The cabman helped him up
the steps and handed him in the door to a brisk old
woman, who must have been an actress in her day; for
she gave a screech at the sight of him, and threw her
arms about him crying out, so that the cabman heard,
"Artie, alanna, back from the dead, back from the dead,
acushla machree." Then the door closed, and Arthur
Dillon was alone with his mother; Arthur Dillon who had
run away to California ten years before, and died there,
it was supposed; but he had not died, for behold him
returned to his mother miraculously. She knew him in
spite of the changes, in spite of thin face, wild eyes, and
strong beard. The mother-love is not to be deceived by
the disguise of time. So Anne Dillon hugged her Arthur
with a fervor that surprised him, and wept copious tears;
thinking more of the boy that might have come back to
her than of this stranger. He lay in his lonely, unknown
grave, and the caresses meant for him had been bought
by another.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ANOTHER MAN'S SHOES.</h3>


<p>As he laid aside his outer garments, Horace felt the joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the exhausted sailor, entering port after a dangerous
voyage. He was in another man's shoes; would they fit
him? He accepted the new house and the new mother
with scarcely a comment. Mrs. Anne Dillon knew him
only as a respectable young man of wealth, whom misfortune
had driven into hiding. His name and his history
she might never learn. So Monsignor had arranged it.
In return for a mother's care and name she was to receive
a handsome income. A slim and well-fashioned woman,
dignified, severe of feature, her light hair and fair complexion
took away ten from her fifty years; a brisk manner
and a low voice matched her sharp blue eyes and calm
face; her speech had a slight brogue; fate had ordained
that an Endicott should be Irish in his new environment.
As she flew about getting ready a little supper, he dozed
in the rocker, thinking of that dear mother who had
illumined his youth like a vision, beautiful, refined, ever
delightful; then of old Martha, rough, plain, and sad,
but with the spirit and wit of the true mother, to cherish
the sorrowful. In love for the child these mothers were
all alike. He felt at home, and admired the quickness
and skill with which Anne Dillon took up her new office.
He noted everything, even his own shifting emotions.
This was one phase of the melancholy change in him: the
man he had cast off rarely saw more than pleased him,
but the new Arthur Dillon had an alert eye for trifles.</p>

<p>"Son dear," said his mother, when they sat down to
tea, "we'll have the evenin' to ourselves, because I didn't
tell a soul what time you were comin', though of course
they all knew it, for I couldn't keep back such good news;
that after all of us thinkin' you dead, you should turn
out to be alive an' well, thank God. So we can spend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
evenin' decidin' jist what to do an' say to-morrow. The
first thing in the mornin' Louis Everard will be over to
see you. Since he heard of your comin', he's been jist
wild, for he was your favorite; you taught him to swim,
an' to play ball, an' to skate, an' carried him around with
you, though he's six years younger than you. He's goin'
to be a priest in time with the blessin' o' God. Then his
mother an' sister, perhaps Sister Mary Magdalen, too; an'
your uncle Dan Dillon, on your father's side, he's the only
relative you have. My folks are all dead. He's a senator,
an' a leader in Tammany Hall, an' he'll be proud of
you. You were very fond of him, because he was a prize-fighter
in his day, though I never thought much of that,
an' was glad when he left the business for politics."</p>

<p>"And how am I to know all these people, mother?"</p>

<p>"You've come home sick," she said placidly, "an' you'll
stay in bed for the next week, or a month if you like. As
each one comes I'll let you know jist who they are. You
needn't talk any more than you like, an' any mistakes will
be excused, you've been away so long, an' come home
so sick."</p>

<p>They smiled frankly at each other, and after tea she
showed him his room, a plain chamber with sacred pictures
on the walls and a photograph of Arthur Dillon over
the bureau.</p>

<p>"Jist as you left it ten years ago," she said with a sob.
"An' your picture as you looked a month before you went
away."</p>

<p>The portrait showed a good-looking and pugnacious boy
of sixteen, dark-haired and large-eyed like himself; but
the likeness between the new and the old Arthur was not
striking; yet any one who wished or thought to find a resemblance
might have succeeded. As to disposition,
Horace Endicott would not have deserted his mother
under any temptation.</p>

<p>"What sort of a boy was&mdash;was I at that age, mother?"</p>

<p>"The best in the world," she answered mildly but
promptly, feeling the doubt in the question. "An' no one
was able to understan' why you ran away as you did.
I wonder now my heart didn't break over it. The neighbors
jist adored you: the best dancer an' singer, the
gayest boy in the parish, an' the Monsignor thought there
was no other like you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have forgotten how to sing an' dance, mother. I
think these accomplishments can be easily learned again.
Does the Monsignor still hold his interest in me?"</p>

<p>"More than ever, I think, but he's a quiet man that
says little when he means a good deal."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock an old woman came in with an evening
paper, and gave a cry of joy at sight of him. Having
been instructed between the opening of the outer door
and the woman's appearance, Arthur took the old lady in
his arms and kissed her. She was the servant of the
house, more companion than servant, wrinkled like an
autumn leaf that has felt the heat, but blithe and active.</p>

<p>"So you knew me, Judy, in spite of the whiskers and
the long absence?"</p>

<p>"Knew you, is it?" cried Judy, laughing, and crying,
and talking at once, in a way quite wonderful to one
who had never witnessed this feat. "An' why shouldn't
I know you? Didn't I hould ye in me own two arrums
the night you were born? An' was there a day afther
that I didn't have something to do wid ye? Oh, ye little
spalpeen, to give us all the fright ye did, runnin' away to
Californy. Now if ye had run away to Ireland, there'd
be some sinse in it. Musha thin, but it was fond o' goold
ye wor, an' ye hardly sixteen. I hope ye brought a pile
of it back wid ye."</p>

<p>She rattled on in her joy until weariness took them all
at the same moment, and they withdrew to bed. He
was awakened in the morning by a cautious whispering in
the room outside his door.</p>

<p>"Pon me sowl," Judy was saying angrily, "ye take it
like anny ould Yankee. Ye're as dull as if 'twas his
body on'y, an' not body an' sowl together, that kem home
to ye. Jist like ould Mrs. Wilcox the night her son died,
sittin' in her room, an' crowshayin' away, whin a dacint
woman 'ud be howlin' wid sorra like a banshee."</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," Anne replied, "I can't quite forgive
him for the way he left me, an' it's so long since I saw
him, Judy, an' he's so thin an' miserable lookin', that I
feel as if he was only a fairy child."</p>

<p>"Mother, you're talking too loud to your neighbors,"
he cried out then in a cheery and familiar voice, for he
saw at once the necessity of removing the very natural
constraint indicated by his mother's words; and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a sudden cry from the women, Judy flying to the kitchen
while Anne came to his door.</p>

<p>"It's true the walls have ears," she said with a kindly
smile. "But you and I, son, will have to make many's
the explanation of that kind before you are well settled in
your old home."</p>

<p>He arose for breakfast with the satisfaction of having
enjoyed a perfect sleep, and with a delightful interest in
what the day had in store for him. Judy bantered and
petted him. His mother carried him over difficult allusions
in her speech. The sun looked in on him pleasantly,
he took a sniff of air from a brickish garden, saw
the brown walls of the cathedral not far away, and then
went back to bed. A sudden and overpowering weakness
came upon him which made the bed agreeable. Here he
was to receive such friends as would call upon him that
day. Anne Dillon looked somewhat anxious over the
ordeal, and his own interest grew sharper each moment,
until the street-door at last opened with decision, and his
mother whispered quickly:</p>

<p>"Louis Everard! Make much of him."</p>

<p>She went out to check the brisk and excited student
who wished to enter with a shout, warning him that the
returned wanderer was a sick man. There was silence
for a moment, and then the young fellow appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Will you have a fit if I come any nearer?" he said
roguishly.</p>

<p>In the soft, clear light from the window Arthur saw a
slim, manly figure, a lovable face lighted by keen blue
eyes, a white and frank forehead crowned by light hair,
and an expression of face that won him on the instant.
This was his chum, whom he had loved, and trained, and
tyrannized over long ago. For the first time since his
sorrow he felt the inrushing need of love's sympathy, and
with tear-dimmed eyes he mutely held out his arms.
Louis flew into the proffered embrace, and kissed him
twice with the ardor of a boy. The affectionate touch of
his lips quite unmanned Arthur, who was silent while the
young fellow sat on the side of the bed with one arm about
him, and began to ply him with questions.</p>

<p>"Tell me first of all," he said, "how you had the heart
to do it, to run away from so many that loved the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you walked on. I cried my eyes out night after night ... and
your poor mother ... and indeed all of us ... how could
you do it? What had we done?"</p>

<p>"Drop it," said Arthur. "At that time I could have
done anything. It was pure thoughtlessness, regretted
many a time since. I did it, and there's the end of it,
except that I am suffering now and must suffer more for
the folly."</p>

<p>"One thing, remember," said Louis, "you must let
them all see that your heart is in the right place. I'm not
going to tell you all that was said about you. But you
must let every one see that you are as good as when you
left us."</p>

<p>"That would be too little, dear heart. Any man that
has been through my experiences and did not show himself
ten times better than ever he was before, ought to
stay in the desert."</p>

<p>"That sounds like you," said Louis, gently pulling his
beard.</p>

<p>"Tell me, partner," said Arthur lightly, "would you
recognize me with whiskers?"</p>

<p>"Never. There is nothing about you that reminds me
of that boy who ran away. Just think, it's ten years, and
how we all change in ten years. But say, what adventures
you must have had! I've got to hear the whole story,
mind, from the first chapter to the last. You are to come
over to the house two nights in a week, to the old room,
you remember, and unfold the secrets of ten years.
Haven't you had a lot of them?"</p>

<p>"A car-load, and of every kind. In the mines and
forests, on the desert, lost in the mountains, hunting and
fishing and prospecting; not to mention love adventures
of the tenderest sort. I feel pleasant to think of telling
you my latest adventures in the old room, where I used to
curl you up with fright&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Over stories of witches and fairies," cried Louis,
"when I would crawl up your back as we lay in bed, and
shiver while I begged you to go on. And the room is just
the same, for all the new things have the old pattern. I
felt you would come back some day with a bag of real
stories to be told in the same dear old place."</p>

<p>"Real enough surely," said Arthur with a deep sigh,
"and I hope they may not tire you in the telling. Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
... tells me that you are going to be a priest. Is that
true?"</p>

<p>"As far as I can see now, yes. But one is never certain."</p>

<p>"Then I hope you will be one of the Monsignor's stamp.
That man is surely a man of God."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it," said Louis, taking his hat to go.</p>

<p>"One thing," said Arthur as he took his hand and detained
him. He was hungry for loving intimacy with this
fine lad, and stammered in his words. "We are to be the
same ... brothers ... that we were long ago!"</p>

<p>"That's for you to say, old man," replied Louis, who
was pleased and even flattered, and petted Arthur's hands.
"I always had to do as you said, and was glad to be your
slave. I have been the faithful one all these years. It is
your turn now."</p>

<p>After that Arthur cared little who came to see him. He
was no longer alone. This youth loved him with the love
of fidelity and gratitude, to which he had no claim except
by adoption from Mrs. Anne Dillon; but it warmed his
heart and cheered his spirit so much that he did not discuss
with himself the propriety of owning and enjoying
it. He looked with delight on Louis' mother when she
came later in the day, and welcomed him as a mother would
a dear son. A nun accompanied her, whose costume gave
him great surprise and some irritation. She was a frank-faced
but homely woman, who wore her religious habit
with distinction. Arthur felt as if he were in a chapel
while she sat by him and studied his face. His mother did
the talking for him, compared his features with the portrait
on the wall, and recalled the mischievous pranks of
his wild boyhood, indirectly giving him much information
as to his former relationships with the visitors. Mrs.
Everard had been fond of him, and Sister Mary Magdalen
had prepared him for his first communion. This fact the
nun emphasized by whispering to him as she was about to
leave:</p>

<p>"I hope you have not neglected your religious duties?"</p>

<p>"Monsignor will tell you," he said with an amused smile.
He found no great difficulty in dealing with the visitors
that came and went during the first week. Thanks to his
mother's tactful management no hitches occurred more
serious than the real Arthur Dillon might have encountered
after a long absence. The sick man learned very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
speedily how high his uncle stood in the city, for the last
polite inquiry of each visitor was whether the Senator had
called to welcome his nephew. In the narrow world of the
Endicotts the average mind had not strength enough to
conceive of a personality which embraced in itself a prize-fighter
and a state senator. The terms were contradictory.
True, Nero had been actor and gladiator, and the inference
was just that an American might achieve equal distinction;
but the Endicott mind refused to consider such an inference.
Arthur Dillon no longer found anything absurd
or impossible. The surprises of his new position charmed
him. Three months earlier and the wildest libeller could
not have accused him of an uncle lower in rank than a
governor of the state. Sonorous names, senator and gladiator,
brimful of the ferocity and dignity of old Rome!
near as they had been in the days of Cæsar, one would
have thought the march of civilization might have widened
the interval. Here was a rogue's march indeed! Judy
gave the Senator a remarkable character.</p>

<p>"The Senator, is it?" said she when asked for an opinion.
"Divil a finer man from here to himself! There
isn't a sowl in the city that doesn't bless his name. He's
a great man bekase he was born so. He began life with
his two fishts, thumpin' other boys wid the gloves, as they
call 'em. Thin he wint to the war, an' began fightin' wid
powdher an' guns, so they med him a colonel. Thin he
kem home an' wint fightin' the boss o' the town, so they
med him a senator. It was all fightin' wid him, an' they
say he's at it yet, though he luks so pleasant all the time,
he must find it healthy. I don't suppose thim he's fightin'
wid finds it as agreeable. Somewan must git the batin',
ye know. There's jist the differ betune men. I've been
usin' me fists all me life, beltin' the washboord, an' I'm
nowhere yet. An' Tommy Kilbride the baker, he's been
poundin' at the dough for thirty years, an' he's no better
off than I am. But me noble Dan Dillon that began wid
punchin' the heads of his neighbors, see where he is to-day.
But he's worthy of it, an' I'd be the last to begrudge
him his luck."</p>

<p>In the Endicott circle the appearance of a senator as
great as Sumner had not been an event to flutter the
heart, though the honor was unquestioned; but never in
his life had the young man felt a keener interest than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the visit of his new uncle. He came at last, a splendid
figure, too ample in outline and too rich in color for the
simple room. The first impression he made was that of
the man. The powerful and subtle essence of the man
breathed from him. His face and figure had that boldness
of line and depth of color which rightly belong to
the well-bred peasant. He was well dressed, and handsome,
with eyes as soft and bright as a Spaniard's.
Arthur was overcome with delight. In Louis he had
found sympathy and love, and in the Senator he felt sure
that he would find ideal strength and ideal manhood,
things for the weak to lean upon. The young patrician
seized his uncle's hand and pressed it hard between his
own. At this affectionate greeting the Senator's voice
failed him, and he had difficulty in keeping back his
tears.</p>

<p>"If your father were only here now, God rest his soul
this day," he said. "How he loved you. Often an'
often he said to me that his happiness would be complete
if he lived to see you a man. He died, but I live to see it,
an' to welcome you back to your own. The Dillons are
dying out. You're the only one of our family with the
family name. What's the use o' tellin' you how glad we
are that Californy didn't swallow you up forever."</p>

<p>Arthur thanked him fervently, and complimented him
on his political honors. The Senator beamed with the
delight of a man who finds the value of honors in the joy
which they give his friends.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've mounted, Artie, an' I came by everything
I have honest. You'll not be ashamed of me, boy, when
you see where I stand outside. But there's one thing
about politics very hard, the enemy don't spare you. If
you were to believe all that's said of me by opponents I'm
afraid you wouldn't shake hands with me in public."</p>

<p>"I suppose they bring up the prize-fighting," said
Arthur. "You ought to have told them that no one need
be ashamed to do what many a Roman emperor did."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried the Senator, "there's where a man feels
the loss of an education. I never knew the emperors did
any ring business. What a sockdologer it would have
been to compare myself with the Roman emperors."</p>

<p>"Then you've done with fighting, uncle?"</p>

<p>There was regret in his tone, for he felt the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
would have been improved if the Senator were still before
the public as a gladiator.</p>

<p>"I see you ain't lost none o' your old time deviltry,
Artie," he replied good-naturedly. "I gave that up long
ago, an' lots o' things with it. But givin' up has nothin'
to do with politics, an' regular all my sins are retailed in
the papers. But one thing they can never say: that I was
a liar or a thief. An' they can't say that I ever broke my
word, or broke faith with the people that elected me, or
did anything that was not becoming in a senator. I respect
that position an' the honor for all they're worth."</p>

<p>"And they can never say," added Arthur, "that you
were afraid of any man on earth, or that you ever hurt
the helpless, or ever deserted a friend or a soul that was
in need."</p>

<p>The Senator flushed at the unexpected praise and the
sincerity of the tone. He was anxious to justify himself
even before this sinner, because his dead brother and his
sister-in-law had been too severe on his former occupations
to recognize the virtues which Arthur complimented.</p>

<p>"Whatever I have been," said the Senator, pressing the
hand which still held his, "I was never less than a square
man."</p>

<p>"That's easy to believe, uncle, and I'll willingly punch
the head of the first man that denies it."</p>

<p>"Same old spirit," said the delighted Senator. "Why,
you little rogue, d'ye remember when you used to go
round gettin' all the pictures o' me in me fightin' days,
an' makin' your dear mother mad by threatenin' to go
into the ring yourself? Why; you had your own fightin'
gear, gloves an' clubs an' all that, an' you trained young
Everard in the business, till his old ... his father put a
head ... put a stop to it."</p>

<p>"Fine boy, that Louis, but I never thought he'd turn
to the Church."</p>

<p>"He never had any thin' else in him," said the Senator
earnestly. "It was born in him as fightin' an' general
wildness was born in you an' me. Look into his face an'
you'll see it. Fine? The boy hasn't his like in the city
or the land. I'll back him for any sum&mdash;I'll stand to it
that he'll be archbishop some day."</p>

<p>"Which I'll never be," said Arthur with a grin.</p>

<p>"Every man in his place, Artie. I've brought you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
yours, if you want to take it. How would politics in
New York suit you?"</p>

<p>"I'm ripe for anything with fun in it."</p>

<p>"Then you won't find fault, Artie, if I ask how things
stood with you&mdash;you see it's this way, Artie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, hold on, old man," said Arthur. "If you are
going to get embarrassed in trying to do something for
me, then I withdraw. Speak right out what you have to
say, and leave me to make any reply that suits me."</p>

<p>"Then, if you'll pardon me, did you leave things in
Californy straight an' square, so that nothin' could be
said about you in the papers as to your record?"</p>

<p>"Straight as a die, uncle."</p>

<p>"An' would you take the position of secretary to the
chief an' so get acquainted with everything an' everybody?"</p>

<p>"On the spot, and thank you, if you can wait till I am
able to move about decently."</p>

<p>"Then it's done, an' I'm the proudest man in the state
to see another Dillon enterin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The ring," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"No, the arena of politics," corrected the Senator. "An'
I can tell from your talk that you have education an' sand.
In time we'll make you mayor of the town."</p>

<p>When he was going after a most affectionate conversation
with his nephew the Senator made a polite suggestion
to Mrs. Dillon.</p>

<p>"His friends an' my friends an' the friends of his
father, an' the rank an' file generally want to see an' to hear
this young man, just as the matter stands. Still more
will they wish to give him the right hand of fellowship
when they learn that he is about to enter on a political
career. Now, why not save time and trouble by just
giving a reception some day about the end of the
month, invite the whole ga&mdash;the whole multitude, do the
thing handsome, an' wind it up forever?"</p>

<p>The Senator had an evident dread of his sister-in-law,
and spoke to her with senatorial dignity. She meekly accepted
his suggestion, and humbly attended him to the
door. His good sense had cleared the situation. Preparation
for a reception would set a current going in the
quiet house, and relieve the awkwardness of the new
relationships; and it would save time in the business of renewing
old acquaintance. They took up the work eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The old house had to be refitted for the occasion, his
mother had to replenish a scanty wardrobe, and he had
to dress himself in the fashion proper to Arthur Dillon.
Anne's taste was good, inclined to rich but simple coloring,
and he helped her in the selection of materials, insisting
on expenditures which awed and delighted her. Judy
Haskell came in for her share of raiment, and carried out
some dread designs on her own person with conviction.
It was pure pleasure to help these simple souls who loved
him.</p>

<p>After a three weeks' stay in the house he went about
the city at his ease, and busied himself with the study and
practise of his new personality. In secret, even from
Louis who spent much of his leisure with him, he began
to acquire the well-known accomplishments of the real
Arthur Dillon, who had sung and danced his way into the
hearts of his friends, who had been a wit for a boy,
bubbling over with good spirits, an athlete, a manager of
amateur minstrels, a precocious gallant among the girls, a
fighter ever ready to defend the weak, a tireless leader in
any enterprise, and of a bright mind, but indifferent to
study. The part was difficult for him to play, since his
nature was staidness itself beside the spontaneity and
variety of Arthur Dillon: but his spirits rose in the effort,
some feeling within responded to the dash and daring of this
lost boy, so much loved and so deeply mourned.</p>

<p>Louis helped him in preparing his wardrobe, very unlike
anything an Endicott had ever worn. Lacking the elegance
and correctness of earlier days, and of a different character,
it was in itself a disguise. He wore his hair long and
thick in the Byronic fashion, and a curly beard shadowed
his lower face. Standing at the glass on the afternoon of
the reception he felt confident that Horace Endicott had
fairly disappeared beneath the new man Dillon. His
figure had filled out slightly, and had lost its mournful
stoop; his face was no longer wolfish in its leanness, and
his color had returned, though melancholy eyes marked
by deep circles still betrayed the sick heart. Yet the
figure in the glass looked as unlike Horace Endicott as
Louis Everard. He compared it with the accurate portrait
sent out by his pursuers through the press. Only
the day before had the story of his mysterious disappearance
been made public. For months they had sought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
quietly but vainly. It was a sign of their despair that the
journals should have his story, his portrait, and a reward
for his discovery.</p>

<p>No man sees his face as others see it, but the difference
between the printed portrait and the reflection of Arthur
Dillon in the mirror was so startling that he felt humbled
and pained, and had to remind himself that this was the
unlikeness he so desired. The plump and muscular figure
of Horace Endicott, dressed perfectly, posed affectively,
expressed the self-confidence of the aristocrat. His
smooth face was insolent with happiness and prosperity,
with that spirit called the pride of life. But for what he
knew of this man, he could have laughed at his self-sufficiency.
The mirror gave back a shrunken, sickly
figure, somewhat concealed by new garments, and the
eyes betrayed a poor soul, cracked and seamed by grief and
wrong; no longer Horace Endicott, broken by sickness
of mind and heart, and disguised by circumstance, but
another man entirely. What a mill is sorrow, thus to
grind up an Endicott and from the dust remold a
Dillon! The young aristocrat, plump, insolent, shallow,
and self-poised, looked commonplace in his pride beside
this broken man, who had walked through the abyss of
hell, and nevertheless saved his soul.</p>

<p>He discovered as he gazed alternately on portrait and
mirror that a singular feeling had taken hold of him.
Horace Endicott all at once seemed remote, like a close
friend swallowed and obliterated years ago by the sea;
while within himself, whoever he might be, some one
seemed struggling for release, or expression, or dominion.
He interpreted it promptly. Outwardly, he was living
the life of Arthur Dillon, and inwardly that Arthur was
making war on Horace Endicott, taking possession as an
enemy seizes a stubborn land, reaching out for those remote
citadels wherein the essence of personality resides.
He did not object. He was rather pleased, though he
shivered with a not unwelcome dread.</p>

<p>The reception turned out a marvelous affair for him who
had always been bored by such ceremonies. His mother,
resplendent in a silk dress of changeable hue, seemed to
walk on air. Mrs. Everard and her daughter Mona assisted
Anne in receiving the guests. The elder women
he knew were Irish peasants, who in childhood had run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
barefoot to school on a breakfast of oatmeal porridge, and
had since done their own washing and baking for a time.
Only a practised eye could have distinguished them from
their sisters born in the purple. Mona was a beauty, who
earned her own living as a teacher, and had the little virtues
of the profession well marked; truly a daughter of
the gods, tall for a woman, with a mocking face all sparkle
and bloom, small eyes that flashed like gems, a sharp
tongue, and a head of silken hair, now known as the Titian
red, but at that time despised by all except artists and
herself. She was a witch, an enchantress, who thought
no man as good as her brother, and showed other men
only the regard which irritates them. And Arthur loved
her and her mother because they belonged to Louis.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you'll like the arrangements,"
Louis said to him, when all things were ready. "This
is not a society affair. It's an affair of the clan. The
Dillons and their friends have a right to attend. So you
must be prepared for hodcarriers as well as aristocrats."</p>

<p>At three o'clock the house and the garden were thrown
open to the stream of guests. Arthur gazed in wonder.
First came old men and women of all conditions, laborers,
servants, small shopkeepers, who had known his father
and been neighbors and clients for years. Dressed in
their best, and joyful over his return to life and home
and friends, they wrung his hands, wept over him, and
blessed him until their warm delight and sincerity nearly
overcame him, who had never known the deep love of the
humble for the head of the clan. The Senator was their
benefactor, their bulwark and their glory; but Arthur
was the heir, the hope of the promising future. They
went through the ceremony of felicitation and congratulation,
chatted for a while, and then took their leave as
calmly and properly as the dames and gallants of a court;
and one and all bowed to the earth with moist and delighted
eyes before the Everards.</p>

<p>"How like a queen she looks," they said of the mother.</p>

<p>"The blessin' o' God on him," they said of Louis, "for
priest is written all over him, an' how could he help it
wid such a mother."</p>

<p>"She's fit for a king," they said of Mona. "Wirra, an'
to think she'd look at a plain man like Doyle Grahame."</p>

<p>But of Anne Dillon and her son they said nothing, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
much were they overcome by surprise at the splendor of
the mother and the son, and the beauty of the old house
made over new. After dark the Senator arrived, which
was the signal for a change in the character of the guests.</p>

<p>"You'll get the aristocracy now, the high Irish," said
Louis.</p>

<p>Arthur recognized it by its airs, its superciliousness,
and several other bad qualities. It was a budding aristocracy
at the ugliest moment of its development; city
officials and their families, lawyers, merchants, physicians,
journalists, clever and green and bibulous, who ran in
with a grin and ran out with a witticism, out of respect
for the chief, and who were abashed and surprised at the
superior insolence of the returned Dillon. Reminded
of the story that he had returned a wealthy man, many
of them lingered. With these visitors however came the
pillars of Irish society, solid men and dignified women,
whom the Senator introduced as they passed. There
were three emphatic moments which impressed Arthur
Dillon. A hush fell upon the chattering crowd one
instant, and people made way for Monsignor O'Donnell,
who looked very gorgeous to Arthur in his purple-trimmed
soutane, and purple cloak falling over his broad shoulders.
The politicians bent low, the flippant grew serious, the
faithful few became reverent. A successful leader was
passing, and they struggled to touch his garments.
Arthur's heart swelled at the silent tribute, for he loved
this man.</p>

<p>"His little finger," said the Senator in a whisper, "is
worth more to them than my whole body."</p>

<p>A second time this wave of feeling invaded the crowd,
when a strong-faced, quiet-mannered man entered the
room, and paid his respects to the Dillons. Again the
lane was made, and hearts fluttered and many hands were
outstretched in greeting to the political leader, Hon. John
Sullivan, the head of Tammany, the passing idol of the
hour, to whom Arthur was soon to be private secretary.
He would have left at once but that the Senator whispered
something in his ear; and presently the two went into
the hall to receive the third personage of the evening, and
came back with him, deeply impressed by the honor of
his presence. He was a short, stocky man, of a military
bearing, with a face so strongly marked as to indicate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
certain ferocity of temperament; his deep and sparkling
eyes had eyebrows aslant after the fashion of Mephisto;
the expression a little cynical, all determination, but at
that moment good-natured. The assembly fell into an
ecstasy at the sight and the touch of their hero, for no
one failed to recognize the dashing General Sheridan.
They needed only a slight excuse to fall at his feet and
adore him.</p>

<p>Arthur was impressed indeed, but his mother had
fallen into a state of heavenly trance over the greatness
which had honored their festival. She recovered only
when the celebrities had departed and the stream of guests
had come to an end. Then came a dance in the garden
for the young people, and the school-friends of Arthur
Dillon made demands upon him for the entertainment of
which his boyhood had given such promise; so he sang
his songs with nerve and success, and danced strange
dances with graceful foot, until the common voice declared
that he had changed only in appearance, which was natural,
and had kept the promise of his boyhood for gayety of
spirits, sweet singing, and fine dancing.</p>

<p>"I feel more than ever to-night," said Louis at parting,
"that all of you has come home."</p>

<p>Reviewing the events of the day in his own room after
midnight, he felt like an actor whose first appearance has
been a success. None of the guests seemed to have any
doubt of his personality, or to feel any surprise at his
appearance. For them Arthur Dillon had come home
again after an adventurous life, and changes were accepted
as the natural result of growth. They took him to their
heart without question. He was loved. What Horace
Endicott could not command with all his wealth, the love
of his own kin, a poor, broken adventurer, Arthur Dillon,
enjoyed in plenty. Well, thank God for the good fortune
which followed so unexpectedly his exit from the past.
He had a secure place in tender hearts for the first time
since father and mother died. What is life without love
and loving? What are love and loving without God?
He could say again, as on the shore of the little pool, I
believe in God forever.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE DILLON CLAN.</h3>


<p>After the reception Arthur Dillon fell easily into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
good graces of the clan, and found his place quite naturally;
but like the suspicious intruder his ears and eyes
remained wide open to catch the general sentiment about
himself, and the varying opinions as to his manners and
character. He began to perceive by degrees the magnitude
of the task which he had imposed upon himself;
the act of disappearing was but a trifle compared with
the relationships crowding upon him in his new environment.
He would be forced to maintain them all with
some likeness to the method which would have come
naturally to the real Dillon. The clan made it easy for
him. Since allowance had to be conceded to his sickly
condition, they formed no decisive opinions about him,
accepting pleasantly, until health and humor would urge
him to speak of his own accord, Anne's cloudy story of
his adventures, of luck in the mines, and of excuses for
his long silence. All observed the new element in his disposition;
the boy who had been too heedless and headlong
to notice anything but what pleased him, now saw
everything; and kept at the same time a careful reserve
about his past and present experiences, which impressed
his friends and filled Judy Haskell with dread.</p>

<p>"Tommy Higgins," she said, to Anne in an interval of
housework, "kem home from Texas pritty much the same,
with a face an him as long as yer arm, an' his mouth shut
up like an old door. Even himself cudn't open it. He
spint money free, an' av coorse that talked for him. But
wan day, whin his mother was thryin' an a velvet sack he
bought for her, an' fightin' him bekase there was no fur
collar to id, in walked his wife an' three childher to him
an' her, an' shtayed wid her ever afther. Begob, she
never said another word about fur collars, an' she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
got another velvet sack till she died. Tommy had money,
enough to kape them all decent, bud not enough for velvet
and silk an' joolry. From that minnit he got back his
tongue, an' he talked himself almost to death about what he
didn't do, an' what he did do in Californy. So they med
him a tax-collecthor an' a shtump-speaker right away, an'
that saved his neighbors from dyin' o' fatague lishtenin'
to his lies. Take care, Anne Dillon, that this b'y o' yours
hastn't a wife somewhere."</p>

<p>Anne was in the precise attitude of old Mrs. Higgins
when her son's wife arrived, fitting a winter cloak to her
trim figure. At the sudden suggestion she sat down
overcome.</p>

<p>"Oh, God forgive you, Judy," said she, "even to mention
such a thing. I forbid you ever to speak of it again.
I don't care what woman came in the door, I'd turn her
out like a thramp. He's mine, I've been widout him ten
years, and I'm going to hold him now against every
schemin' woman in the world."</p>

<p>"Faith," said Judy, "I don't want to see another
woman in the house anny more than yerself. I'm on'y
warnin' yez. It 'ud jist break my heart to lose the grandher
he's afther puttin' on yez."</p>

<p>The two women looked about them with mournful
admiration. The house, perfect in its furnishings, delighted
the womanly taste. In Anne's wardrobe hung
such a collection of millinery, dresses, ornaments, that
the mere thought of losing it saddened their hearts.
And the loss of that future which Anne Dillon had seen
in her own day-dreams ... she turned savagely on
Judy.</p>

<p>"You were born wid an evil eye, Judy Haskell," cried
she, "to see things no wan but you would ever think of.
Never mention them again."</p>

<p>"Lemme tell ye thin that there's others who have somethin'
to say besides meself. If they're in a wondher over
Artie, they're in a greater wondher over Artie's mother,
buyin' silks, an' satins, an' jools like an acthress, an'
dhressin' as gay as a greenhorn jist over from Ireland."</p>

<p>"They're jealous, an' I'm goin' to make them more so,"
said Anne with a gleeful laugh, as she flung away care and
turned to the mirror. For the first time since her youth
she had become a scandal to her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Judy kept Arthur well informed of the general feeling
and the common opinion, and he took pains not only to
soothe his mother's fright but also to explain the little
matters which irritated her friends. Mrs. Everard did
not regard the change in Anne with complacency.</p>

<p>"Arthur is changed for the better, but his mother for
the worse," she said to Judy, certain that the old lady
would retail it to her mistress. "A woman of fifty, that
always dressed in dark colors, sensibly, to take all at once
to red, and yellow, and blue, and to order bonnets like
the Empress Eugenie's ... well, one can't call her
crazy, but she's on the way."</p>

<p>"She has the money," sighed Mona, who had none.</p>

<p>"Sure she always had that kind of taste," said Judy in
defence, "an' whin her eyes was blue an' her hair yalla,
I dunno but high colors wint well enough. Her father
always dhressed her well. Anyhow she's goin' to make
up for all the years she had to dhress like an undertaker.
Yistherday it was a gran' opery-cloak, as soon as Artie
tould her he had taken four opery sates for the season."</p>

<p>The ladies gasped, and Mona clapped her hands at the
prospect of unlimited opera, for Anne had always been
kind to her in such matters.</p>

<p>"But all that's nawthin'," Judy went on demurely,
"to what's comin' next week. It's a secret o' coorse, an'
I wudn't have yez mintion it for the world, though yez'll
hear it soon enough. Micksheen has a new cage all silver
an' goold, an' Artie says he has a piddygree, which manes
that they kep' thrack of him as far back as Adam an'
Eve, as they do for lords an' ladies; though how anny of
'em can get beyant Noah an' the ark bates me. Now
they're puttin' Micksheen in condition, which manes all
sorts of nonsense, an' plenty o' throuble for the poor cat,
that does be bawlin' all over the house night an' day wid the
dhread of it, an' lukkin' up at me pitiful to save him from
what's comin'. Artie has enthered his name at the polis
headquarthers somewhere, that he's a prize cat, an' he's
to be sint in the cage to the cat show to win a prize over
fifty thousand other cats wid piddygrees. They wanted
me to attind on Micksheen, but I sed no, an' so they've
hired a darky in a uniform to luk after him. An' wanst
a day Anne is goin' to march up to the show in a different
dhress, an' luk in at Micksheen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point Judy's demureness gave way and she
laughed till the tears came. The others could not but
join.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the top of the hill," said Mrs. Everard.
"Surely Arthur ought to know enough to stop that tomfoolery.
If he doesn't I will, I declare."</p>

<p>Arthur however gave the affair a very different complexion
when she mentioned it.</p>

<p>"Micksheen is a blooded cat," said he, "for Vandervelt
presented it to the Senator, who gave it to mother.
And I suggested the cat-show for two reasons: mother's
life has not been any too bright, and I had a big share in
darkening it; so I'm going to crowd as much fun into it
as she is willing to stand. Then I want to see how Micksheen
stands in the community. His looks are finer than
his pedigree, which is very good. And I want every one
to know that there's nothing too good in New York for
mother, and that she's going to have a share in all the
fun that's going."</p>

<p>"That's just like you, and I wish you luck," said Mary
Everard.</p>

<p>Not only did he go about explaining, and mollifying
public sentiment himself, he also secured the services of
Sister Mary Magdalen for the same useful end. The nun
was a puzzle to him. Encased in her religious habit like
a knight in armor, her face framed in the white gamp
and black veil, her hands hidden in her long sleeves, she
seemed to him a fine automaton, with a sweet voice and
some surprising movements; for he could not measure
her, nor form any impression of her, nor see a line of her
natural disposition. Her human side appeared very
clearly in her influence with the clan, her sincere and
affectionate interest in himself, and her appetite for news
in detail. Had she not made him live over again the late
reception by her questions as to what was done, what
everybody said, and what the ladies wore? Unwearied
in aiding the needy, she brought him people of all sorts
and conditions, in whom he took not the slightest interest,
and besought his charity for them. He gave it in exchange
for her good will, making her clearly understand
that the change in his mother's habits must not lead to
anything like annoyance from her old friends and
neighbors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," she exclaimed, "for annoyance would
only remove you from our midst, and deprive us of a great
benefactor, for I am sure you will prove to be that. May
I introduce to you my friend, Miss Edith Conyngham?"</p>

<p>He bowed to the apparition which came forward, seized
his hands, held them and patted them affectionately,
despite his efforts to release them.</p>

<p>"We all seem to have known you since childhood,"
was her apology.</p>

<p>The small, dark woman, pale as a dying nun, irritated
him. Blue glasses concealed her eyes, and an ugly costume
concealed her figure; she came out of an obscure
corner behind the nun, and fell back into it noiselessly,
but her voice and manner had the smoothness of velvet.
He looked at her hands patting his own, and found them
very soft, white, untouched by age, and a curious contrast
to her gray hair. Interest touching him faintly he
responded to her warmth, and looked closely into the blue
glasses with a smile. Immediately the little woman sank
back into her corner. Long after he settled the doubt
which assailed him at that moment, if there were not significance
in her look and words and manner. Sister Magdalen
bored him ten minutes with her history. He must
surely take an interest in her ... great friend of his father's
... and indeed of his friends ... her whole life devoted to religion
and the poor ... the recklessness of others had driven
her from a convent where she had been highly esteemed
... she had to be vindicated ... her case was well on the way
to trial ... nothing should be left undone to make it a
triumph. Rather dryly he promised his aid, wondering
if he had really caught the true meaning of the little
woman's behavior. He gave up suspicion when Judy provided
Miss Conyngham with a character.</p>

<p>"This is the way of it," said Judy, "an' it's aisy
to undhershtan' ... thin agin I dinno as it's so aisy ... but
annyway she was a sisther in a convent out west, an'
widout lave or license they put her out, bekase she wudn't
do what the head wan ordhered her to do. So now she's
in New York, an' Sisther Mary Mag Dillon is lukkin
afther her, an' says she must be righted if the Pope himself
has to do it. We all have pity an her, knowin'
her people as we did. A smarter girl never opened a
book in Ameriky. An' I'm her godmother."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we must do something for her," said the master
kindly in compliment to Judy. After his mother and Judy
none appealed to him like the women of the Everard home.
The motherly grace of Mary and the youthful charm of
beautiful Mona attracted him naturally; from them he
picked up stray features of Arthur Dillon's character;
but that which drew him to them utterly was his love
for Louis. Never had any boy, he believed, so profoundly
the love of mother and sister. The sun rose and set with
him for the Everards, and beautiful eyes deepened in
beauty and flashed with joy when they rested on him.
Arthur found no difficulty in learning from them the
simple story of the lad's childhood and youth.</p>

<p>"How did it happen," he inquired of Mary, "that he
took up the idea of being a priest? It was not in his
mind ten years back?"</p>

<p>"He was the priest from his birth," she answered
proudly. "Just seven months old he was when a first
cousin of mine paid us a visit. He was a young man,
ordained about a week, ... we had waited and prayed
for that sight ten years ... he sang the Mass for us and
blessed us all. It was beautiful to see, the boy we had
known all his life, to come among us a priest, and to say
Mass in front of Father O'Donnell&mdash;I never can call him
Monsignor&mdash;with the sweetest voice you ever heard. Well,
the first thing he did when he came to my house and Louis
was a fat, hearty baby in the cradle, was to take him in
his arms, look into his face a little while, and then kiss
him. And I'll never forget the words he said."</p>

<p>Her dark eyes were moist, but a smile lighted up her
calm face.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said to me, "this boy should be the first
priest of the next generation. I'll bless him to that end,
and do you offer him to God. And I did. He was the
roughest child of all mine, and showed very little of the
spirit of piety as he grew up. But he was always the best
boy to his own. He had the heart for us all, and never
took his play till he was sure the house was well served.
Nothing was said to him about being a priest. That was
left to God. One winter he began to keep a little diary,
and I saw in it that he was going often to Mass on week
days, and often to confession. He was working then with
his father in the office, since he did not care much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
school. Then the next thing I knew he came to me
one night and put his arms about me to say that he
wished to be a priest, to go to college, and that this very
cousin who had blessed him in the cradle had urged him
to make known the wish that was in him, for it seems he
discovered what we only hoped for. And so he has been
coming and going ever since, a blessing to the house, and
sure I don't know how I shall get along without him when
he goes to the seminary next year."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Arthur with a start. "How can you
ever think of giving him up?"</p>

<p>"That's the first thing we have to learn," she replied
with a smile at his passion. "The children all leave the
house in time one way or another. It's only a question
of giving him to God's service or to the service of another
woman. I could never be jealous of God."</p>

<p>He laughed at this suggestion of jealousy in a mother.
Of course she must hate the woman who robs her of her
son, and secures a greater love than a mother ever knew.
The ways of nature, or God, are indeed hard to the flesh.
He thought of this as he sat in the attic room with his
light-hearted chum. He envied him the love and reverence
of these good women, envied him that he had been
offered to God in his infancy; and in his envy felt a satisfaction
that very soon these affectionate souls would soon
have to give Louis up to Another. To him this small
room was like a shrine, sacred, undefiled, the enclosure
of a young creature specially called to the service of man,
perfumed by innocence, cared for by angels, let down
from heaven into a house on Cherry Street. Louis had
no such fancies, but flung aside his books, shoved his chum
into a chair, placed his feet on a stool, put a cigar in his
mouth and lighted it for him, pulled his whiskers, and
ordered the latest instalment of Dillon's Dark Doings in
Dugout. Then the legends of life in California began.
Sometimes, after supper, a knock was heard at the door,
and there entered two little sisters, who must hear a bear-story
from Arthur, and kiss the big brother good-night;
two delicate flowers on the rough stem of life, that filled
Horace Endicott with bitterness and joy when he gathered
them into his embrace; the bitterness of hate, the joy of
escape from paternity. What softness, what beauty,
what fragrance in the cherubs! <i>Trumps</i>, their big brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
called them, but the world knew them as Marguerite and
Constance, and they shared the human repugnance to an
early bed.</p>

<p>"You ought to be glad to go to bed," Arthur said,
"when you go to sleep so fast, and dream beautiful dreams
about angels."</p>

<p>"But I don't dream of angels," said Marguerite sadly.
"Night before last I dreamed a big black man came out
of a cellar, and took baby away," casting a look of love
at Constance in her brother's arms.</p>

<p>"And I dreamed," said Constance, with a queer little
pucker of her mouth, "that she was all on fire, in her
dress, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was the limit of her language, for the thought of
her sister on fire overwhelmed the words at her command.</p>

<p>"And baby woke up," the elder continued&mdash;for she
was a second mother to Constance, and pieced out all her
deficiencies and did penance for her sins&mdash;"and she said
to mother, 'throw water on Marguerite to put her out.'"</p>

<p>"What sad dreams," Arthur said. "Tell Father
O'Donnell about them."</p>

<p>"She has other things to tell him," Louis said with a
grin. "I have no doubt you could help her, Artie. She
must go to confession sometime, and she has no sins to
tell. The other day when I was setting out for confession
she asked me not to tell all my sins to the priest, but to
hold back a few and give them to her for her confession.
Now you have enough to spare for that honest use, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, dear cousin Artie," said the child, thrilling
his heart with the touch of her tender lips on his cheek.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt I have enough," he cried with a
secret groan. "When you are ready to go, Marguerite,
I will give you all you want."</p>

<p>The history of Arthur's stay in California was drawn
entirely from his travels on the Pacific slope, tedious to
the narrator, but interesting because of the lad's interest,
and because of the picture which the rapt listener made.
His study-desk near by, strewn with papers and books,
the white bed and bookcase farther off, pictures and
mottoes of his own selection on the white walls, a little
altar in the depths of the dormer-window; and the lord
of the little domain in the foreground, hands on knees,
lips parted, cheeks flushed, eyes fixed and dreamy, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the rich colors and varied action as soon as words conveyed
the story to the ear; a perfect picture of the listening boy,
to whom experience like a wandering minstrel sings the
glory of the future in the happenings of the past.</p>

<p>Arthur invariably closed his story with a fit of sighing.
That happy past made his present fate heavy indeed.
Horace Endicott rose strong in him then and protested
bitterly against Arthur Dillon as a usurper; but sure
there never was a gentler usurper, for he surrendered so
willingly and promptly that Endicott fled again into his
voluntary obscurity. Louis comforted those heavy moments
with soft word and gentle touch, pulling his beard
lovingly, smoothing his hair, lighting for him a fresh
cigar, asking no questions, and, when the dark humor deepened,
exorcising the evil spirit with a sprinkling of holy
water. Prayers were said together&mdash;an overpowering
moment for the man who rarely prayed to see this faith
and its devotion in the boy&mdash;and then to bed, where
Louis invariably woke to the incidents of the day and retailed
them for an hour to his amused ear; and with the
last word fell into instant and balmy sleep. Oh, this
wonder of unconscious boyhood! Had this sad-hearted
man ever known that blissful state? He lay there listening
to the soft and regular breathing of the child, who
knew so little of life and evil. At last he fell asleep
moaning. It was Louis who woke with a sense of fright,
felt that his bedfellow was gone, and heard his voice at
the other side of the room, an agonized voice that chilled
him.</p>

<p>"To go back would be to kill her ... but I must go back
... and then the trail of blood over all...."</p>

<p>Louis leaped out of bed, and lit the night-candle.
Arthur stood beside the altar in the dormer-window,
motionless, with pallid face and open eyes that saw nothing.</p>

<p>"Why should such a wretch live and I be suffering?&mdash;she
suffers too ... but not enough ... the child ... oh, that
was the worst ... the child ... my child...."</p>

<p>The low voice gave out the words distinctly and without
passion, as of one repeating what was told to him.
Rid of fear Louis slapped him on the shoulder and shook
him, laughing into his astonished face when sense came
back to him.</p>

<p>"It's like a scene, or a skene from Macbeth," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Say, Artie, you had better make open confession of
your sins. Why should you want to kill her, and put the
trail of blood over it all?"</p>

<p>"I said that, did I?" He thought a moment, then
put his arms about Louis. They were sitting on the side
of the bed.</p>

<p>"You must know it sometime, Louis. It is only for
your ear now. I had a wife ... she was worthless ... she
lives ... that is all."</p>

<p>"And your child? you spoke of a child?"</p>

<p>Arthur shook with a chill and wiped the sweat from his
forehead.</p>

<p>"No," he groaned, "no ... thank God for that ... I
had no child."</p>

<p>After a little they went back to bed, and Louis made
light of everything with stories of his own sleep-walking
until he fell asleep again. The candle was left burning.
Misfortune rose and sat looking at the boy curiously.
With the luck of the average man, he might have been
father to a boy like this, a girl like Mona with beautiful
hair and a golden heart, soft sweet babies like the Trumps.
He leaned over and studied the sleeping face, so sweetly
mournful, so like death, yet more spiritual, for the soul
was there still. In this face the senses had lost their daylight
influence, had withdrawn into the shadows; and
now the light of innocence, the light of a beautiful soul,
the light that never was on land or sea, shone out of the
still features. A feeling which had never touched his
nature before took fierce possession of him, and shook him
as a tiger shakes his prey. He had to writhe in silence,
to beat his head with his hands, to stifle words of rage
and hate and despair. At last exhausted he resigned himself,
he took the boy's hand in his, remembering that this
innocent heart loved him, and fell into a dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>The charm and the pain of mystery hung about the new
life, attracting him, yet baffling him at every step. He
could not fathom or grasp the people with whom he lived
intimately, they seemed beyond him, and yet he dared
ask no questions, dared not go even to Monsignor for explanations.
With the prelate his relations had to take
that character which suited their individual standing.
When etiquette allowed him to visit the rector, Monsignor
provided him with the philosophy of the environ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>ment,
explained the difficulties, and soothed him with
the sympathy of a generous heart acquainted with his
calamities.</p>

<p>"It would have been better to have launched you elsewhere,"
he said, "but I knew no other place well enough
to get the right people. And then I have the hope that
the necessity for this episode will not continue."</p>

<p>"Death only will end it, Monsignor. Death for one
or the other. It should come soon, for the charm of this
life is overpowering me. I shall never wish to go back
if the charm holds me. My uncle, the Senator, is about
to place me in politics."</p>

<p>"I knew he would launch you on that stormy sea," Monsignor
answered reflectively, "but you are not bound to
accept the enterprise."</p>

<p>"It will give me distraction, and I need distraction from
this intolerable pain," tapping his breast with a gesture
of anguish.</p>

<p>"It will surely counter-irritate. It has entranced men
like the Senator, and your chief; even men like Birmingham.
They have the ambition which runs with great
ability. It's a pity that the great prizes are beyond them."</p>

<p>"Why beyond them?"</p>

<p>"High office is closed to Catholics in this country."</p>

<p>"Here I run up against the mysterious again," he
complained.</p>

<p>"Go down into your memory," Monsignor said after a
little reflection, "and recall the first feeling which obscurely
stirred your heart when the ideas of <i>Irish</i> and
<i>Catholic</i> were presented to you. See if it was not distrust,
dislike, irritation, or even hate; something different
from the feeling aroused by such ideas as <i>Turk</i> and
<i>atheist</i>."</p>

<p>"Dislike, irritation, perhaps contempt, with a hint of
amusement," Arthur replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"How came that feeling there touching people of whom
you knew next to nothing?"</p>

<p>"Another mystery."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you. Hatred and contempt of the Irish
Catholic has been the mark of English history for four
centuries, and the same feelings have become a part of
English character. It is in the English blood, and therefore
it is in yours. It keeps such men as Sullivan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Birmingham out of high office, and now it will act against
you, strangely enough."</p>

<p>"I understand. Queer things, rum things in this world.
I am such a mystery to myself, however, that I ought not
be surprised at outside mysteries."</p>

<p>"I often regret that I helped you to your present enterprise,"
said the priest, "on that very account. Life is
harsh enough without adding to its harshness."</p>

<p>"Never regret that you saved a poor fellow's life, reason,
fortune, family name from shame and blood," Arthur
answered hotly. "I told you the consequences that were
coming&mdash;you averted them&mdash;there's no use to talk of
gratitude&mdash;and through you I came to believe in God
again, as my mother taught me. No regret, for God's
sake."</p>

<p>His voice broke for a moment, and he walked to the
window. Outside he saw the gray-white walls which
would some day be the grand cathedral. The space about
it looked like the studio of a giant artist; piles of marble
scattered here and there gave the half-formed temple the
air of a frowsy, ill-dressed child; and the mass rising to
the sky resembled a cloud that might suddenly melt into
the ether. He had seen the great temples of the world,
yet found in this humbler, but still magnificent structure
an element of wonder. From the old world, ancient, rich
in tradition, one expected all things; centaurs might
spring from its soil unnoticed. That the prosaic rocks of
Manhattan should heave for this sublimity stirred the
sense of admiring wonder.</p>

<p>"This is your child?" said Arthur abruptly.</p>

<p>"I saw the foundation laid when I was a youth, great
boulders of half-hewn rock, imbedded in cement, to endure
with the ages, able to support whatever man may
pile upon them. This building is part of my life&mdash;you
may call it my child&mdash;for it seems to have sprung from
me, although a greater planned it."</p>

<p>"What a people to attempt this miracle," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Now you have said it," cried the priest proudly.
"The poor people to whom you now belong, moved by the
spirit which raised the great shrines of Europe, are building
out of their poverty and their faith the first really
great temple on this continent. The country waited for
them. This temple will express more than a desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have protection from bad weather, and to cover the
preacher's pulpit. Here you will have in stone faith,
hope, love, sacrifice. What blessings it will pour out
upon the city, and upon the people who built it. For
them it will be a great glory many centuries perhaps."</p>

<p>"I shall have my share in the work," Arthur said with
feeling. "I feel that I am here to stay, and I shall be a
stranger to no work in which my friends are engaged.
I'll not let the mysteries trouble me. I begin to see
what you are, and a little of what you mean. Command
me, for no other in this world to-day has any right to command
me&mdash;none with a right like yours, father and friend."</p>

<p>"Thanks and amen, Arthur. Having no claim upon
you we shall be all the more grateful. But in good time.
For the present look to yourself, closely, mind; and draw
upon me, upon Louis, upon your mother, they have the
warmest hearts, for sympathy and consolation."</p>

<p>Not long before and Arthur Dillon would have received
with the polite indifference of proud and prosperous youth
this generous offer of sympathy and love; but now it shook
him to the center, for he had learned, at what a fearful
price! how precious, how necessary, how rare is the jewel
of human love.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE WEARIN' O' THE GREEN.</h3>


<p>By degrees the effervescence of little Ireland, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
strange land his fortune had been cast, began to steal into
his blood. Mirth ruled the East side, working in each
soul according to his limitations. It was a wink, a smile,
a drink, a passing gossoon, a sly girl, a light trick, among
the unspoken things; or a biting epigram, the phrase
felicitous, a story gilt with humor, a witticism swift and
fatal as lightning; in addition varied activity, a dance informal,
a ceremonious ball, a party, a wake, a political
meeting, the visit of the district leader; and with all, as
Judy expressed it, "lashins an' lavins, an' divil a thought
of to-morrow." Indeed this gay clan kept Yesterday so
deeply and tenderly in mind that To-day's house had no
room for the uncertain morrow. He abandoned himself to
the spirit of the place. The demon of reckless fun
caught him by the heels and sharpened his tongue, so
that his wit and his dancing became tonics for eyes and
ears dusty with commonplace. His mother and his chum
had to admonish him, and it was very sweet to get this
sign of their love for him. Reproof from our beloved is
sweeter than praise from an enemy.</p>

<p>They all watched over him as if he were heir to a throne.
The Senator, busy with his approaching entrance into
local politics, had already introduced him to the leaders,
who formed a rather mixed circle of intelligence and
power. He had met its kind before on the frontier, where
the common denominator in politics was manhood, not
blue blood, previous good character, wealth, nor the
stamp of Harvard. A member held his place by virtue
of courage, popularity, and ability. Arthur made no inquiries,
but took everything as it came. All was novelty,
all surprise, and to his decorous and orderly disposition,
all ferment. The clan seemed to him to be rushing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>ward
like a torrent night and day, from the dance to the
ward-meeting, from business to church, interested and
yet careless. The Senator informed him with pride that
his début would take place at the banquet on St. Patrick's
Day, when he should make a speech.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can do it, me boy?" said the
Senator. "If you think you can, why you can."</p>

<p>"I know I can," said the reckless Dillon, who had
never made a speech in his life.</p>

<p>"An' lemme give you a subject," said Judy. They
were all together in the sitting-room, where the Senator
had surprised them in a game of cards.</p>

<p>"Give a bastin' to Mare Livingstone," said Judy
seriously. "I read in the <i>Sun</i> how he won't inspect the
parade on St. Patrick's Day, nor let the green flag fly on
the city hall. There must be an Orange dhrop in his
blood, for no dacint Yankee 'ud have anny hathred for
the blessed green. Sure two years ago Mare Jones dressed
himself up in a lovely green uniform, like an Irish prince,
an' lukked at the parade from a platform. It brought the
tears to me eyes, he lukked so lovely. They ought to
have kep' him Mare for the rest of his life. An' for
Mare Livingstone, may never a blade o' grass or a green
leaf grow on his grave."</p>

<p>The Senator beamed with secret pleasure, while the
others began to talk together with a bitterness beyond
Arthur's comprehension.</p>

<p>"He ought to have kept his feelings to himself," said
quiet Anne. "If he didn't like the green, there was no
need of insultin' us."</p>

<p>"And that wasn't the worst," Louis hotly added. "He
gave a talk to the papers the next day, and told how
many Irish paupers were in the poorhouse, and said how
there must be an end to favoring the Irish."</p>

<p>"I saw that too," said Judy, "an' I sez to meself, sez
I, he's wan o' the snakes St. Pathrick dhruv out of Ireland."</p>

<p>"No need for surprise," Mona remarked, studying her
cards, "for the man has only one thought: to keep the
Irish in the gutter. Do you suppose I would have been a
teacher to-day if he could have kept me out of it, with all
his pretended friendship for papa."</p>

<p>"If you baste the Mayor like this now, there won't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
much left for me to do at the banquet," said Arthur with
a laugh for their fierceness.</p>

<p>"Ay, there it is," said Judy. "Yez young Americans
have no love for the green, except for the fun yez get out
of it; barrin' dacint Louis here, who read the history of
Ireland whin he was tin years old, an' niver got over it.
Oh, yez may laugh away! Ye are all for the red, white,
an' blue, till the Mare belts yez wid the red, white, an' blue,
for he says he does everythin' in honor o' thim colors,
though I don't see how it honors thim to insult the
green. He may be a Livingshtone in name, but he's a dead
wan for me."</p>

<p>The Senator grew more cheerful as this talk grew
warmer, and then, seeing Arthur's wonderment, he made
an explanation.</p>

<p>"Livingstone is a good fellow, but he's not a politician,
Artie. He thinks he can ru&mdash;manage the affairs of this
vil&mdash;metropolis without the Irish and especially without
the Catholics. Oh, he's death on them, except as boot-blacks,
cooks, and ditch-diggers. He'd let them ru&mdash;manage
all the saloons. He's as mad&mdash;as indignant as a
hornet that he could not boo&mdash;get rid of them entirely
during his term of office, and he had to speak out his
feelings or bu&mdash;die. And he has put his foot in it
artistically. He has challenged the Irish and their
friends, and he goes out of office forever next fall. No party
wants a man that lets go of his mouth at critical moments.
It might be a neat thing for you to touch him up in your
speech at the banquet."</p>

<p>The Senator spoke with unctuousness and delight, and
Arthur saw that the politicians rejoiced at the loquacity
and bad temper of the Honorable Quincy Livingstone,
whom the Endicotts included among their distant relatives.</p>

<p>"I'll take your subject, Judy," said he.</p>

<p>"Then rade up the histhory of Ireland," replied the
old lady flattered.</p>

<p>Close observation of the present proved more interesting
and amusing than the study of the past. Quincy Livingstone's
strictures on the exiles of Erin stirred them to the
depths, and his refusal to float the green flag from the
city hall brought a blossoming of green ribbon on St.
Patrick's Day which only Spring could surpass in her
decorations of the hills. The merchants blessed the sour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
spirit which had provoked this display to the benefit of
their treasuries. The hard streets seemed to be sprouting
as the crowds moved about, and even the steps and corridors
of the mayor's office glistened with the proscribed
color. The cathedral on Mott Street was the center of
attraction, and a regiment which had done duty in the
late war the center of interest. Arthur wondered at the
enthusiasm of the crowd as the veterans carrying their
torn battle-flags marched down the street and under the
arched entrance of the church to take their places for the
solemn Mass. All eyes grew moist, and sobs burst forth
at sight of them.</p>

<p>"If they were only marching for Ireland!" one man
cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>"They'll do it yet," said another more hopeful.</p>

<p>Within the cathedral a multitude sat in order, reverently
quiet, but charged with emotion. With burning eyes
they watched the soldiers in front and the priests in the
sanctuary, and some beat their breasts in pain, or writhed
with sudden stress of feeling. Arthur felt thrilled by
the power of an emotion but vaguely understood.
These exiles were living over in this moment the scenes
which had attended their expulsion from home and country,
as he often repeated the horrid scenes of his own tragedy.
Under the reverence and decorum due to the temple
hearts were bursting with passion and grief. In a little
while resignation would bring them relief and peace.</p>

<p>It was like enchantment for Arthur Dillon. He knew
the vested priest for his faithful friend; but on the altar,
in his mystic robes, uplifted, holding the reverent gaze of
these thousands, in an atmosphere clouded by incense and
vocal with pathetic harmonies, the priest seemed as far
away as heaven; he knew in his strength and his weakness
the boy beside him, but this enwrapped attitude, this
eloquent, still, unconscious face, which spoke of thoughts
and feelings familiar only to the eye of God, seemed to
lift Louis into another sphere; he knew the people kneeling
about, the headlong, improvident, roystering crowd,
but knew them not in this outpouring of deeper emotions
than spring from the daily chase for bread and pleasure.</p>

<p>A single incident fixed this scene in his mind and heart
forever. Just in front of him sat a young woman with
her father, whom she covertly watched with some anxiety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He was a man of big frame and wasted body, too nervous
to remain quiet a moment, and deeply moved by the
pageant, for he twisted his hands and beat his breast as if
in anguish. Once she touched his arm caressingly. And
the face which he turned towards her was stained with the
unwiped tears; but when he stood up at the close of the
Mass to see the regiment march down the grand aisle, his
pale face showed so bitter an agony that Arthur recalled
with horror his own sufferings. The young woman clung
to her father until the last soldier had passed, and the
man had sunk into his seat with a half-uttered groan.
No one noticed them, and Arthur as he left with the
ladies saw her patting the father's hand and whispering to
him softly.</p>

<p>Outside the cathedral a joyous uproar attended the
beginning of that parade which the Mayor had declined to
review. As his party was to enjoy it at some point of Fifth
Avenue he did not tarry to witness the surprising scenes
about the church, but with Louis took a car uptown.
Everywhere they heard hearty denunciations of the Mayor.
At one street, their car being detained by the passing of a
single division of the parade, the passengers crowded
about the front door and the driver, and an anxious
traveler asked the cause of the delay, and the probable
length of it. The driver looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"About five minutes," he said. "Don't you know who's
paradin' to-day?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"See the green plumes an' ribbons?"</p>

<p>"I do," vacantly.</p>

<p>"Know what day o' the month it is?"</p>

<p>"March seventeenth, of course."</p>

<p>"Live near New York?"</p>

<p>"About twenty miles out."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" exclaimed the driver with a gasp. "I've
bin a-drivin' o' this car for twenty years, an' I never met
anythin' quite so innercent. Well, it's St. Patrick's Day,
an' them's the wild Irish."</p>

<p>The traveler seemed but little enlightened. An emphatic
man in black, with a mouth so wide that its opening
suggested the wonderful, seized the hand of the innocent
and shook it cordially.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to meet one uncontaminated American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
citizen in this city," he said. "I hope there are millions
like you in the land."</p>

<p>The uncontaminated looked puzzled, and might have
spoken but for a violent interruption. A man had entered
the car with an orange ribbon in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take that off," said the conductor in
alarm, pointing to the ribbon, "or leave the car."</p>

<p>"I won't do either," said the man.</p>

<p>"And I stand by you in that refusal," said the emphatic
gentleman. "It's an outrage that we must submit to the
domination of foreigners."</p>

<p>"It's the order of the company," said the conductor.
"First thing we know a wild Irishman comes along, he
goes for that orange ribbon, there's a fight, the women are
frightened, and perhaps the car is smashed."</p>

<p>"An' besides," said the deliberate driver as he tied up
his reins and took off his gloves, "it's a darn sight easier
an' cheaper for us to put you off than to keep an Irishman
from tryin' to murder you."</p>

<p>The uncontaminated citizen and two ladies fled to the
street, while the driver and the conductor stood over the
offending passenger.</p>

<p>"Goin' to take off the ribbon?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"You will be guilty of a cowardly surrender of principle
if you do," said the emphatic gentleman.</p>

<p>"May I suggest," said Arthur blandly, "that you wear
it in his stead?"</p>

<p>"I am not interested either way," returned the emphatic
one, with a snap of the terrible jaws, "but maintain that
for the sake of principle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long speech was cut off at that moment by a war-cry
from a simple lad who had just entered the car, spied the
ribbon, and launched himself like a catapult upon the
Orange champion. A lively scramble followed, but the
scene speedily resolved itself into its proper elements.
The procession had passed, the car moved on its way, and
the passengers through the rear door saw the simple lad
grinding the ribbon in the dust with triumphant heel,
while its late wearer flew toward the horizon pursued by
an imaginary mob. Louis sat down and glared at the
emphatic man.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" said Arthur with interest, drawing his
breath with joy over the delights of this day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a child-stealer," said Louis with distinctness.
"He kidnaps Catholic children and finds them Protestant
homes where their faith is stolen from them. He's the
most hated man in the city."</p>

<p>The man accepted this scornful description of himself
in silence. Except for the emphasis which nature had
given to his features, he was a presentable person. Flying
side-whiskers made his mouth appear grotesquely
wide, and the play of strong feelings had produced vicious
wrinkles on his spare face. He appeared to be a man of
energy, vivacity and vulgarity, reminding one of a dinner of
pork and cabbage. He was soon forgotten in the excitement
of a delightful day, whose glories came to a brilliant
end in that banquet which introduced the nephew of Senator
Dillon into political life.</p>

<p>Standing before the guests, he found himself no longer
that silent and disdainful Horace Endicott, who on such
an occasion would have cooly stuttered and stammered
through fifty sentences of dull congratulation and platitude.
Feeling aroused him, illumined him, on the instant,
almost without wish of his own, at the contrast between
two pictures which traced themselves on his imagination
as he rose in his place: the wrecked man who had fled from
Sonia Westfield, what would he have been to-night but for
the friendly hands outstretched to save him? Behold
him in honor, in health, in hope, sure of love and some
kind of happiness, standing before the people who had
rescued him. The thousand impressions of the past six
months sparkled into life; the sublime, pathetic, and
amusing scenes of that day rose up like stars in his fancy;
and against his lips, like water against a dam, rushed
vigorous sentences from the great deeps opened in his soul
by grief and change, and then leaped over in a beautiful,
glittering flood. He wondered vaguely at his vehemence
and fluency, at the silence in the hall, that these great
people should listen to him at all. They heard him with
astonishment, the leaders with interest, the Senator with
tears; and Monsignor looked once towards the gallery
where Anne Dillon sat literally frozen with terror and
pride.</p>

<p>The long and sincere applause which followed the
speech warned him that he had impressed a rather callous
crowd of notables, and an exaltation seized him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
guests lost no time in congratulating him, and every
tongue wagged in his favor.</p>

<p>"You have the gift of eloquence," said Sullivan.</p>

<p>"It will be a pleasure to hear you again," said Vandervelt,
the literary and social light of the Tammany circle.</p>

<p>"You have cleared your own road," Birmingham the
financier remarked, and he stayed long to praise the young
orator.</p>

<p>"There's nothin' too good for you after to-night,"
cried the Senator brokenly. "I simply can't&mdash;cannot talk
about it."</p>

<p>"Your uncle," said Doyle Grahame, the young journalist
who was bent on marrying Mona Everard, "as usual
closes the delicate sparring of his peers with a knockdown
blow; there's nothing too good for you."</p>

<p>"It's embarrassing."</p>

<p>"I wish I had your embarrassment. Shall I translate
the praises of these great men for you? Sullivan meant,
I must have the use of your eloquence; the lion Vandervelt,
when you speak in my favor; Birmingham, please
stump for me when I run for office; and the Senator, I
will make you governor. You may use your uncle; the
others hope to use you."</p>

<p>"I am willing to be of service," said Arthur severely.</p>

<p>"A good-nature thrown away, unless you are asked to
serve. They have all congratulated you on your speech.
Let me congratulate you on your uncle. They marvel at
your eloquence; I, at your luck. Give me such an uncle
rather than the gift of poesy. Do not neglect oratory,
but cultivate thy uncle, boy."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed, Monsignor came up then, and heaped
him with praise.</p>

<p>"Were you blessed with fluency in&mdash;your earlier years?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Therein lies the surprise, and the joke. I never had
an accomplishment except for making an uproar in a crowd.
It seems ridiculous to show signs of the orator now, without
desire, ambition, study, or preparation."</p>

<p>"Your California experiences," said the priest casually,
"may have something to do with it. But let me warn you,"
and he looked about to make sure no one heard, "that
early distinction in your case may attract the attention you
wish to escape."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel that it will help me," Arthur answered. "Who
that knew Horace Endicott would look for him in a
popular Tammany orator? The mantle of an Irish
Cicero would disguise even a Livingstone."</p>

<p>The surprise and pleasure of the leaders were cold beside
the wild delight of the Dillon clan when the news went
around that Arthur had overshadowed the great speakers
of the banquet. His speech was read in every gathering,
its sarcastic description of the offensive Livingstone filled
the Celts with joy, and threw Anne and Judy into an
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Faith, Mare Livingstone'll see green on St. Patrick's
Day for the rest of his life," said Judy. "It' ud be a proper
punishment if the bread he ate, an' everythin' he touched
on that day, shud turn greener than ould Ireland, the land
he insulted."</p>

<p>"There's curse enough on him," Anne replied sharply,
ever careful to take Arthur's side, as she thought, "and
I won't have you spoiling Arthur's luck be cursing any wan.
I'm too glad to have an orator in the family. I can now
put my orator against Mary Everard's priest, and be as
proud as she is."</p>

<p>"The pride was born in ye," said Judy. "You won't
have to earn it. Indade, ye'll have a new flirt to yer tail,
an' a new toss to yer head, every day from now to his next
speech."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? I'm his mother," with emphasis.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE VILLA AT CONEY ISLAND.</h3>


<p>The awkwardness of his relations with Anne Dillon wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
away speedily, until he began to think as well as speak of
her as his mother; for she proved with time to be a
humorous and delightful mother. Her love for rich
colors and gay scenes, her ability to play gracefully the
awkward part which he had chosen for her, her affectionate
and discreet reserve, her delicate tact and fine wit, and
her half-humorous determination to invade society, showed
her as a woman of parts. He indulged her fancies, in
particular her dream of entering the charmed circle of
New York society. How this success should be won, and
what was the circle, he did not know, nor care. The
pleasure for him lay in her bliss as she exhausted one
pleasure after another, and ever sought for higher things:
Micksheen at the cat show attended by the liveried
mulatto; the opera and the dog show, with bonnets and
costumes to match the occasion; then her own carriage,
used so discreetly as not to lose the respect of the parish;
and finally the renting of the third pew from the front in
the middle aisle of the cathedral, a step forward in the
social world. How he had enjoyed these events in her
upward progress! As a closing event for the first year of
his new life, he suggested a villa by the sea for the summer,
with Mona and Louis as guests for the season, with as
many others as pleased her convenience. The light which
broke over her face at this suggestion came not from
within, but direct from heaven!</p>

<p>She sent him modestly to a country of the Philistines
known as Coney Island, where he found the common herd
enjoying a dish called chowder amid much spontaneity
and dirt, and mingling their uproarious bathing with
foaming beer; a picture framed in white sand and sounding
sea, more than pleasant to the jaded taste of an Endicott.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The roar of the surf drowned the mean uproar of discordant
man. The details of life there were too cheap to be
looked at closely; but at a distance the surface had
sufficient color and movement. He found an exception
to this judgment. La Belle Colette danced with artistic
power, though in surroundings unsuited to her skill. He
called it genius. In an open pavilion, whose roughness
the white sand and the white-green surf helped to condone,
on a tawdry stage, she appeared, a slight, pale,
winsome beauty, clad in green and white gauze, looking
like a sprite of the near-by sea. The witchery of her
dancing showed rare art, which was lost altogether on the
simple crowd. She danced carelessly, as if mocking the
rustics, and made her exit without applause.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your artiste, August?" he said to
a waiter.</p>

<p>"You saw how well she dances, hey? Poor Colette!
The best creature in the world ... opens more wine than
five, and gives too much away. But for the drink she
might dance at the opera."</p>

<p>Arthur went often to see her dance, with pity for the
talent thrown away, and brought his mother under protest
from that cautious lady, who would have nothing to do with
so common a place. The villa stood in respectable, even
aristocratic, quiet at the far end of the island, and Anne
regarded it almost with reverence, moving about as if in
a temple. He found, however, that she had made it a
stage for a continuous drama, in which she played the
leading part, and the Dillon clan with all its ramifications
played minor characters and the audience. Her motives
and her methods he could not fathom and did not try; the
house filled rapidly, that was enough; the round of
dinners, suppers, receptions, dances, and whatnots had
the regularity of the tides. Everybody came down from
Judy's remotest cousin up to His Grace the archbishop.
Even Edith Conyngham, apparently too timid to leave the
shadow of Sister Magdalen, stole into a back room with
Judy, and haunted the beach for a few days. For Judy's
sake he turned aside to entertain her, and with the perversity
which seems to follow certain actions he told her the
pathetic incident of the dancer. Why he should have
chosen this poor nun to hear this tale, embellished as if to
torture her, he could never make out. Often in after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
years, when events had given the story significance, he
sought for his own motives in vain. It might have been
the gray hair, the rusty dress, the depressed manner, so
painful a contrast to the sea-green sprite, all youth, and
grace, and beauty, which provoked him.</p>

<p>"I shall pray for the poor thing," said rusty Edith,
fingering her beads, and then she made to grasp his hand,
which he thrust into his pockets.</p>

<p>"Not a second time," he told Louis. "I'd rather get
the claw of a boiled lobster."</p>

<p>The young men did not like Miss Conyngham, but Louis
pitied her sad state.</p>

<p>The leading characters on Anne's stage, at least the
persons whom she permitted occasionally to fill its center,
were the anxious lovers Mona and Doyle Grahame. He was
a poet to his finger-tips, dark-haired, ruddy, manly, with
clear wit, and the tenderest and bravest of dark eyes; and
she, red-tressed, lovely, candid, simple, loved him with her
whole heart while submitting to the decree of a sour father
who forbade the banns. Friends like Anne gave them the
opportunity to woo, and the Dillon clan stood as one to
blind the father as to what was going on. The sight of
this beauty and faith and love feeding on mutual confidence
beside the sunlit surf and the moonlight waters gave
Arthur profound sadness, steeped his heart in bitterness.
Such scenes had been the prelude to his tragedy. Despair
looked out of his eyes and frightened Louis.</p>

<p>"Why should you mind it so, after a year?" the lad
pleaded.</p>

<p>"Time was when I minded nothing. I thought love
and friendship, goodness and happiness, grew on every
bush, and that</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 33%;">
<div class="poem">
When we were far from the lips that we loved,<br />
We had but to make love to the lips that were near.<br />
</div></div>

<p>I am wiser now."</p>

<p>"Away with that look," Louis protested. "You have
love in plenty with us, and you must not let yourself go
like that. It's frightful."</p>

<p>"It's gone," Arthur answered rousing himself. "The
feeling will never go farther than a look. She was not
worth it&mdash;but the sight of these two&mdash;I suppose Adam
must have grieved looking back at paradise."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have their troubles also," Louis said to distract
his mind. "Father is unkind and harsh with Irish
patriots, and because Grahame went through the mill,
conspiracy, arrest, jail, prison, escape, and all the rest of
it, he won't hear of marriage for Mona with him. Of
course he'll have to come down in time. Grahame is the
best fellow, and clever too."</p>

<p>One day seemed much the same as another to Arthur,
but his mother's calendar had the dates marked in various
colors, according to the rank of her visitors. The visit of
the archbishop shone in figures of gold, but the day and
hour which saw Lord Constantine cross her threshold and
sit at her table stood out on the calendar in letters of flame.
The Ledwiths who brought him were of little account, except
as the friends of His Lordship. Anne informed the
household the day before of the honor which heaven was
sending them, and gave minute instructions as to the etiquette
to be observed; and if Arthur wished to laugh the
blissful light in her face forbade. The rules of etiquette
did not include the Ledwiths, who could put up with ordinary
politeness and be grateful.</p>

<p>"I can see from the expression of Mona," Arthur observed
to the other gentlemen, "that the etiquette of to-morrow
puts us out of her sight. And who is Lord Constantine?
I ought to know, so I did not dare ask."</p>

<p>"A young English noble, son and heir of a Marquis,"
said Grahame with mock solemnity, "who is devoted to
the cause of bringing London and Washington closer together
in brotherly love and financial, that is rogues'
sympathy&mdash;no, roguish sympathy&mdash;that's better. He
would like an alliance between England and us. Therefore
he cultivates the Irish. And he'd marry Honora
Ledwith to-morrow if she'd have him. That's part of the
scheme."</p>

<p>"And who are the Ledwiths?" said Arthur incautiously,
but no one noticed the slip at the moment.</p>

<p>"People with ideas, strange weird ideas," Louis made
answer. "Oh, perfectly sane, of course, but so devoted
to each other, and the cause of Ireland, that they can get
along with none, and few can get along with them. That's
why Pop thinks so much of 'em. They are forever running
about the world, deep in conspiracies for freedom,
and so on, but they never get anywhere to stay. Outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of that they're the loveliest souls the sun ever shone on,
and I adore Honora."</p>

<p>"And if Mona takes to His Lordship," said Grahame,
"I'll worship Miss Ledwith."</p>

<p>"Very confusing," Arthur muttered. "English noble,&mdash;alliance
between two countries&mdash;cultivates Irish&mdash;wants
to marry Irish girl&mdash;conspirators and all that&mdash;why, there's
no head or tail to the thing."</p>

<p>"Well, you keep your eye on Honora Ledwith and me,
and you'll get the key. She's the sun of the system. And,
by the way, don't you remember old Ledwith, the red-hot
lecturer on the woes of Ireland? Didn't you play on her
doorstep in Madison street, and treat her to Washington
pie?"</p>

<p>When the party arrived next day Arthur saw a handsome,
vigorous, blond young man, hearty in his manner,
and hesitating in his speech, whom he forgot directly in
his surprise over the Ledwiths; for he recognized in them
the father and daughter whom he had observed in so passionate
a scene in the cathedral on St. Patrick's Day. He
had their history by heart, the father being a journalist
and the daughter a singer; they had traveled half the
world; and while every one loved them none favored their
roseate schemes for the freedom of Ireland. Perhaps this
had made them peculiar. At the first glance one would
have detected oddity as well as distinction in them. Tall,
lean, vivacious, Owen Ledwith moved about restlessly,
talked much, and with considerable temper. The daughter
sat placid and watchful, quite used to playing audience
to his entertainments; though her eyes never seemed to
look at him, Arthur saw that she missed none of his movements,
never failed to catch his words and to smile her
approval. The whiteness of her face was like cream, and
her dark blue eyes were pencilled by lashes so black that
at the first glance they seemed of a lighter shade. Impressed
to a degree by what at that instant could not be
put into words, he named her in his own mind the White
Lady. No trace of disdain spoiled her lofty manner, yet
he thought she looked at people as if they were minor instruments
in her own scheme. She made herself at home
like one accustomed to quick changes of scene. A woman
of that sort travels round the globe with a satchel, and
dresses for the play with a ribbon and a comb, never find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>ing
the horizon too large for personal comfort. Clearly
she was beloved in the Dillon circle, for they made much
of her; but of course that day not even the master of the
house was a good second to Lord Constantine. Anne
moved about like herself in a dream. She was heavenly,
and Arthur enjoyed it, offering incense to His Lordship,
and provoking him into very English utterances. The
young man's fault was that he rode his hobby too
hard.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, doncheknow," he cried as soon as he
could decently get at his favorite theme, "that the English-speaking
peoples should be so hopelessly divided just
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Lord Conny," interrupted Grahame, "you're
talking Greek to Dillon. Arthur, m'lud has a theory that
the English-speaking peoples should do something together,
doncheknow, and the devil of it is to get 'em together,
doncheknow."</p>

<p>They all laughed save Anne, who looked awful at this
scandalous mimicry of a personage, until His Lordship
laughed too.</p>

<p>"You are only a journalist," said he gayly, "and talk
like your journal. As I was saying, we are divided at
home, and here it is much worse. The Irish here hate
us worse than their brethren at home hate us, doncheknow&mdash;thank
you, Miss Ledwith, I really will not use that
word again&mdash;and all the races settled with you seem to
dislike one another extremely. In Canada it's no better,
and sometimes I would despair altogether, only a beginning
must be made sometime; and I am really doing very
well among the Irish."</p>

<p>He looked towards Honora who smiled and turned
again to Arthur with those gracious eyes.</p>

<p>"I knew you would not forget it," she said. "The
Washington pie in itself would keep it in your mind.
How I loved that pie, and every one who gave me some.
Your coming home must have been very wonderful to
your dear mother."</p>

<p>"More wonderful than I could make you understand,"
murmured Arthur. "Do you know the old house is still
in Madison street, where we played and ate the pie?"</p>

<p>Louis put his head between them slyly and whispered:</p>

<p>"I can run over to the baker's if you wish and get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
chunk of that identical pie, if you're so in love with it,
and we'll have the whole scene over again."</p>

<p>No persuasion could induce the party to remain over
night at the villa, because of important engagements in
the city touching the alliance and the freedom of Erin;
and the same tremendous interests would take them far
away the next morning to be absent for months; but the
winter would find them in the city and, when they would
be fairly settled, Arthur was bid to come and dine with
them often. On the last boat the White Lady sailed away
with her lord and father, and Anne watched the boat
out of sight, sighing like one who has been ravished to
the third heaven, and finds it a distressing job to get a
grip on earth again.</p>

<p>Arthur noticed that his mother dressed particularly
well for the visits of the politicians, and entertained
them sumptuously. Was she planning for his career?
Delicious thought! But no, the web was weaving for
the Senator. When the last knot was tied, she threw it
over his head in perfect style. He complimented her
on her latest costume. She swung about the room with
mock airs and graces to display it more perfectly, and
the men applauded. Good fortune had brought her
back a likeness of her former beauty, angles and wrinkles
had vanished, there was luster in her hair, and her melting
eyes shone clear blue, a trifle faded. In her old age
the coquette of twenty years back was returning with a
charm which caught brother and son.</p>

<p>"I shall wear one like it at your inauguration, Senator,"
said she brightly.</p>

<p>"For President? Thank you. But the dress reminds
me, Anne," the Senator added with feeling, "of what
you were twenty years ago: the sweetest and prettiest
girl in the city."</p>

<p>"Oh, you always have the golden word," said she,
"and thank you. But you'll not be elected president,
only mayor of our own city."</p>

<p>"It might come&mdash;in time," the Senator thought.</p>

<p>"And now is the time," cried she so emphatically that
he jumped. "Vandervelt told me that no man could be
elected unless you said the word. Why shouldn't you
say it for yourself? He told me in the same breath he'd
like to see you in the place afore any friend he had, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>cause
you were a man o' your word, and no wan could
lose be your election."</p>

<p>"Did he say all that?"</p>

<p>"Every word, and twice as much," she declared with
eagerness. "Now think it over with all your clever
brains, Senator dear, and lift up the Dillon name to the
first place in the city. Oh, I'd give me life to see that
glory."</p>

<p>"And to win it," Arthur added under his breath.</p>

<p>The Senator was impressed, and Arthur had a feeling akin
to awe. Who can follow the way of the world? The
thread of destiny for the great city up the bay lay between
the fingers of this sweet, ambitious house-mother, and of
the popular gladiator. Even though she should lead the
Senator by the nose to humiliation, the scene was wonderfully
picturesque, and her thought daring. He did not
know enough history to be aware that this same scene
had happened several hundred times in past centuries;
but he went out to take another look at the house which
sheltered a woman of pluck and genius. The secret of
the villa was known. Anne had used it to help in the
selection of the next Mayor. He laughed from the depths
of his being as he walked along the shore.</p>

<p>The Everard children returned home early in September
to enjoy the preparations for the entrance of Louis into
the seminary. The time had arrived for him to take up
the special studies of the priesthood, and this meant his
separation from the home circle forever. He would come
and go for years perhaps, but alas! only as a visitor.
The soul of Arthur was knit with the lad's as Jonathan
with David. He had never known a youth so gracious
and so strange, whose heart was like a sanctuary where</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Parting with him was a calamity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you let him go?" he said to Mary Everard,
busy with the preparations.</p>

<p>"I am a happy woman that God calls my boy to His
service," she answered cheerfully. "The children go anyway
... it's nature. I left father and mother for my own
home. How good it is to think he is going to the sanctuary.
I know that he is going forever ... he is mine no
more ... he will come back often, but he is mine no more.
I am heart-broken ... I am keeping a gay face while he is
here, for the child must not be worried with our grief ...
time enough for that when he is gone ... and he is so
happy. My heart is leaving me to go with him. Twenty
years since he was born, and in all that time not a moment's
pain on his account ... all his life has been ours
... as if he were the father of the family. What shall
I be for the rest of my life, listening for his step and his
voice, and never a sight or sound of him for months at a
time. God give me strength to bear it. If I live to see
him on the altar, I shall thank God and die...."</p>

<p>Twenty years she had served him, yet here came the inevitable
end, as if such love had never been.</p>

<p>"Oh, you people of faith! I believe you never suffer,
nor know what suffering is!"</p>

<p>"Not your kind of suffering, surely, or we would die.
Our hope is always with us, and fortunately does not depend
on our moods for its power."</p>

<p>Mona teased him into good humor. That was a great
moment when in presence of the family the lad put on the
dress of the seminary, Arthur's gift. Feeling like a prince
who clothes his favorite knight in his new armor, Arthur
helped him to don the black cassock, tied the ribbons of
the surplice, and fixed the three-cornered cap properly on
the brown, curly head. A pallor spread over the mother's
face. Mona talked much to keep back her tears, and the
father declared it a shame to make a priest of so fine a
fellow, since there were too many priests in the world for
its good. The boy walked about as proud as a young soldier
dressed for his first parade. The Trumps, enraptured at
the sight, clapped their hands with joy.</p>

<p>"Why, he's a priest," cried Constance, with a twist of
her pretty mouth. "Louis is a priest."</p>

<p>"No, Baby," corrected Marguerite, the little mother,
"but he is going to be one sometime."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The wonderful garments enchanted them, they feared to
touch him, and protested when he swung them high and
kissed them on the return flight. The boy's departure for
the seminary stirred the region of Cherry Hill. The old
neighbors came and went in a steady procession for two
days to take their leave of him, to bless his parents, and to
wish them the joy of seeing him one day at the altar as a
priest of God. They bowed to him with that reverence which
belonged to Monsignor, only more familiar and loquacious,
and each brought his gift of respect or affection. Even
the Senator and the Boss appeared to say a parting word.</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, Louis," the Senator said in his resonant
voice, and with the speaker's chair before his eyes,
"and I know you'll get it, because you have deserved it,
sir. I've seen you grow up, and I've always been proud to
know you, and I want to know you as long as I live. If
ever you should need a hand like mine in the ga ... I
mean, if ever my assistance is of any use to you, you know
where to call."</p>

<p>"You have a hard road to travel," the genial Sullivan
said at the close of his visit, "but your training has
prepared you for it, and we all hope you will walk it honorably
to the end. Remember we all take an interest in you,
and what happens to you for good or ill will be felt in this
parish."</p>

<p>Then the moment of parting came, and Arthur thought
less of his own grief than of the revelation it contained for
him. Was this the feeling which prompted the tears of
his mother, and the tender, speechless embrace of his dear
father in the far-off days when he set out for school? Was
this the grief which made the parting moment terrible?
Then he had thought it nothing that for months of the
year they should be without his beloved presence! He
shivered at the last embraces of Mary and Mona, at the
tears of the children; he saw behind the father's mask of
calmness; he wondered no more at himself as he stood
looking after the train which bore the boy away. The city
seemed as vacant all at once as if turned into a desert. The
room in the attic, with its bed, its desk, and its altar, suddenly
became a terrible place, like a body from which the
soul has fled. Every feature of it gave him pain, and he
hurried back with Mona to the frivolity of Anne in her
villa by the sea.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE HUMORS OF ELECTION.</h3>


<p>When the villa closed the Senator was hopelessly enmeshed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the golden net which had been so skilfully and
genially woven by Anne during the summer. He believed
himself to be the coming man, all his natural
shrewdness and rich experience going for naught before
the witchery of his sister's imagination. In her mind the
climax of the drama was a Dillon at the top of the heap
in the City Hall. Alas, the very first orders of the chief
to his secretary swept away the fine-spun dreams of the
Dillons, as the broom brushes into obscure dirt the wondrous
cobweb. The Hon. John Sullivan spoke in short
sentences, used each man according to that man's nature,
stood above and ahead of his cleverest lieutenants, had few
prejudices, and these noble, and was truly a hero on the
battle-ground of social forces, where no artillery roars, no
uniforms glare, and no trumpets sound for the poets. The
time having come for action he gave Arthur his orders on
the supposition that he understood the political situation,
which he did in some degree, but not seriously. The
Endicotts looked upon elections as the concern of the
rabble, and this Endicott thought it perhaps an occasion
for uproarious fun. His orders partly sobered him.</p>

<p>"Go to your uncle," said Sullivan, "and tell him he's
not in the race. I don't know where he got that bee in
his bonnet. Then arrange with Everard to call on Livingstone.
Do what you can to straighten the Mayor out.
He ought to be the candidate."</p>

<p>This dealing with men inspired him. Hitherto
he had been playing with children in the garden of
life; now he stood with the fighters in the terrible arena.
And his first task was to extinguish the roseate dreams of
Anne and her gladiator, to destroy that exquisite fabric
woven of moonlit seas, enchanting dinners, and Parisian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
millinery. Never! Let the chief commit that sacrilege!
He would not say the word whose utterance might wound
the hearts that loved him. The Senator and Anne should
have a clear field. High time for the very respectable
citizens of the metropolis to secure a novelty for mayor, to
get a taste of Roman liberty, when a distinguished member
of the arena could wear the purple if he had the mind.</p>

<p>Birmingham forced him to change his attitude. The
man of money was both good-hearted and large-minded,
and had departed from the ways of commerce to seek distinction
in politics. Stolid, without enthusiasm or dash,
he could be stubbornly great in defence of principle.
Success and a few millions had not changed his early
theories of life. Pride in his race, delight in his religion,
devotion to his party, increased in him as he rose to honor
and fame. Arthur Dillon felt still more the seriousness of
the position when this man came to ask his aid in securing
the nomination.</p>

<p>"There never was a time in the history of the city,"
said Birmingham, "when a Catholic had such a chance
to become mayor as now. Protestants would not have
him, if he were a saint. But prejudice has abated, and
confidence in us has increased since the war. Sullivan
can have the position if he wants it. So can many others.
All of them can afford to wait, while I cannot. I am not
a politician, only a candidate. At any moment, by the
merest accident, I may become one of the impossibles. I
am anxious, therefore, to secure the nomination this
year. I would like to get your influence. Where the
balance is often turned by the weight of a hair one cannot
be too alert."</p>

<p>"Do you think I have influence?" said Arthur
humbly.</p>

<p>"You are the secretary," Birmingham answered, surprised.</p>

<p>"I shall have to use it in behalf of my uncle then."</p>

<p>"And if your uncle should not run?"</p>

<p>"I should be happy to give you my support."</p>

<p>Birmingham looked as blank as one before whom a door
opens unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"You understand," continued Arthur, "that I have
been absent too long to grasp the situation clearly. I
think my uncle aspires...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very worthy man," murmured Birmingham.</p>

<p>"You seem to think he has not much of a chance...."</p>

<p>"I know something of Sullivan's mind," Birmingham
ventured, "and you know it still better. The exploits of
the Senator in his youth&mdash;really it would be well for him
not to expose himself to public ridicule...."</p>

<p>"I had not thought of that," said Arthur, when the
other paused delicately. "You are quite right. He
should not expose himself. As no other has done me the
honor to ask my help, I am free to help you."</p>

<p>"You are more than kind. This nomination means
election, and election means the opening of a fine career
for me. Beyond lie the governorship, the senate, and
perhaps higher things. To us these high offices have been
closed as firmly as if they were in Sweden. I want the
honor of breaking down the barriers."</p>

<p>"It is time. I hope you will get the honor," said
Arthur gravely. He felt sadly about the Senator, and the
shining ambition of his mother. How could he shatter
their dreams? Yet in very pity the task had to be done,
and when next he heard them vaporing on the glory of the
future, he said casually:</p>

<p>"I know what your enemies will say if you come into
contrast with Livingstone."</p>

<p>"I've heard it often enough," answered the Senator
gayly. "If I'd listened to them I'd be still in the ring."</p>

<p>Then a suspicion overcame him, and he cried out
bitterly:</p>

<p>"Do you say the same, Artie?"</p>

<p>"Rot. There isn't another like you in the whole world,
uncle. If my vote could do it you'd go into the White
House to-morrow. If you're in earnest in this business of
the nomination, then I'm with you to the last ditch. Now
when you become mayor of the first city in the land"&mdash;Oh,
the smile which flashed on the faces of Anne and
the Senator at this phrase!&mdash;"you become also the target
of every journal in the country, of every comic paper, of
every cartoonist. All your little faults, your blunders,
past and present, are magnified. They sing of you in the
music-halls. Oh, there would be no end to it! Ridicule
is worse than abuse. It would hurt your friends more
than you. You could not escape it, and no one could
answer it. Is the prize worth the pain?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he looked out of the window to escape seeing
the pain in his mother's face, and the bitterness in the
Senator's. He did not illustrate his contention with examples,
for with these the Senator and his friends were
familiar. A light arose on the poor man's horizon.
Looking timidly at Anne, after a moment's pause, he
said:</p>

<p>"I never thought of all that. You've put me on the
right track, Artie. I thank you."</p>

<p>"What can I do," he whispered to Anne, "since it's
plain he wants me to give in&mdash;no, to avoid the comic
papers?"</p>

<p>"Whatever he wishes must be done," she replied with a
gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"The boy is a wonder," thought the Senator. "He
has us all under that little California thumb."</p>

<p>"I was a fool to think of the nomination," he said aloud
as Arthur turned from the window. "Of course there'd
be no end to the ridicule. Didn't the chap on Harper's,
when I was elected for the Senate, rig me out as a gladiator,
without a stitch on me, actually, Artie, not a stitch&mdash;most
indecent thing&mdash;and show old Cicero in the same
picture looking at me like John Everard, with a sneer,
and singing to himself: a senator! No, I couldn't stand
it. I give up. I've got as high as my kind can go. But
there's one thing, if I can't be mayor myself, I can say
who's goin' to be."</p>

<p>"Then make it Birmingham, uncle," Arthur suggested.
"I would like to see him in that place next to you."</p>

<p>"And Birmingham it is, unless"&mdash;he looked at Anne
limp with disappointment&mdash;"unless I take it into my
head to name you for the place."</p>

<p>She gave a little cry of joy and sat up straight.</p>

<p>"Now God bless you for that word, Senator. It'll be a
Dillon anyway."</p>

<p>"In that case I make Birmingham second choice,"
Arthur said seriously, accepting the hint as a happy ending
to a rather painful scene.</p>

<p>The second part of the Chief's order proved more entertaining.
To visit the Mayor and sound him on the question
of his own renomination appeared to Arthur amusing
rather than important; because of his own rawness for
such a mission, and also because of their relationship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Livingstone was his kinsman. Of course John Everard
gave the embassy character, but his reputation reflected
on its usefulness. Nature had not yet provided a
key to the character of Louis' father. Arthur endured
him because Louis loved him, quoted him admiringly, and
seemed to understand him most of the time; but he could
not understand an Irishman who maintained, as a principle
of history, the inferiority of his race to the English,
traced its miseries to its silly pride, opposed all schemes of
progress until his principle was accepted, and placed the
salvation of his people in that moment when they should
have admitted the inferiority imposed by nature, and laid
aside their wretched conceit. This perverse nature had a
sociable, even humorous side, and in a sardonic way loved
its own.</p>

<p>"I have often wondered," Arthur said, when they were
discussing the details of the mission to Livingstone, "how
your tough fiber ever generated beings so tender and beautiful
as Mona, and Louis, and the Trumps. And now I'm
wondering why Sullivan associates you and me in this
business. Is it his plan to sink the Mayor deeper in his
own mud?"</p>

<p>"Whatever his plan I'd like to know what he means in
sending with me to the noblest official in the city and the
land, for that matter, the notorious orator of a cheap
banquet."</p>

<p>"I think it means that Quincy must apologize to the
Irish, or nominate himself," said Arthur slowly.</p>

<p>A lively emotion touched him when he first entered the
room where the Mayor sat stately and gracious. In him
the Endicott features were emphatic and beautiful. Tall,
ruddy, perfectly dressed, with white hair and moustache
shining like silver, and dark blue eyes full of fire, the
aristocrat breathed from him like a perfume. His greeting
both for Everard and Dillon had a graciousness tinged
with contempt; a contempt never yet perceived by
Everard, but perceived and promptly answered on Arthur's
part with equal scorn.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dillon comes from Sullivan," said Everard, "to
ask you, as a condition of renomination, that you take
back your remarks on the Irish last winter. You did
them good. They are so soaked in flattery, the flattery of
budding orators, that your talk wakes them to the truth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I take nothing back," said the Mayor in a calm, sweet
voice to which feeling gave an edge.</p>

<p>"Then you do not desire the nomination of Tammany
Hall?" Arthur said with a placid drawl, which usually
exasperated Everard and other people.</p>

<p>"But I do," the Mayor answered quickly, comprehending
on the instant the quality of this antagonist, feeling
his own insolence in the tone. "I merely decline the
conditions."</p>

<p>"Then you must nominate yourself, for the Irish won't
vote for you," cried Everard.</p>

<p>"The leaders would like to give you the nomination,
Mr. Livingstone. You may have it, if you can find the
means to placate offended voters for your behavior and
your utterances on St. Patrick's Day."</p>

<p>"Go down on your knees at once, Mayor," sneered
Everard.</p>

<p>"I hope Your Honor does not pay too much attention
to the opinions of this gentleman," said Arthur with a
gesture for his companion. "He's a Crusoe in politics.
There's no one else on his island. You have a history,
sir, which is often told in the Irish colony here. I have
heard it often since my return home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is the gentleman who spoke of your policy at the
Donnybrook banquet," Everard interrupted.</p>

<p>Livingstone made a sign for silence, and took a closer
look at Arthur.</p>

<p>"The Irish do not like you, they have no faith in you
as a fair man, they say that you are always planning
against them, that you are responsible for the deviltries
practised upon them through gospel missions, soup
kitchens, kidnapping industries, and political intrigues.
Whether these things be true, it seems to me that a candidate
ought to go far out of his way to destroy such
fancies."</p>

<p>"A very good word, fancies! Are you going to make
your famous speech over again?" said Everard with the
ready sneer.</p>

<p>"Can you deny that what I have spoken is the
truth?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary that he should," Livingstone
answered quietly. "I am not interested in what some
people say of me. Tell Mr. Sullivan I am ready to ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>cept
the nomination, but that I never retract, never desert
a position."</p>

<p>This young man nettled and irritated the Mayor. His
insolence, the insolence of his own class, was so subtly and
politely expressed, that no fault could be found; and,
though his inexperience was evident, he handled a ready
blade and made no secret of his disdain. Arthur did not
know to what point of the compass the short conversation
had carried them, but he took a boy's foolish delight in
teasing the irritated men.</p>

<p>"It all comes to this: you must nominate yourself,"
said Everard.</p>

<p>"And divide the party?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure it would divide the party," Livingstone
condescended to say, for he was amused at the simple
horror of Dillon. "It might unite it under different circumstances."</p>

<p>"That's the remark of a statesman. And it would rid
us, Arthur Dillon, of Sullivan and his kind, who should
be running a gin-mill in Hester street."</p>

<p>"If he didn't have a finer experience in politics, and a
bigger brain for managing men than any three in the city,"
retorted Arthur icily. "He is too wise to bring the prejudices
of race and creed into city politics. If Your Honor
runs on an independent ticket, the Irish will vote against
you to a man. One would think that far-seeing men, interested
in the city and careful of the future, would hesitate
to make dangerous rivalries of this sort. Is there not
enough bigotry now?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know," said the Mayor with a pretence of
indifference. "We are all eager to keep the races in good
humor, but at the same time to prevent the ascendancy of
a particular race, except the native. It is the Irish to-day.
It will be the Germans to-morrow. Once checked
thoroughly, there will be no trouble in the future."</p>

<p>The interview ended with these words. By that time
Arthur had gone beyond his political depth, and was glad
to make his adieu to the great man. He retained one
honest conclusion from the interview.</p>

<p>"Birmingham can thank this pig-headed gentleman,"
said he to Everard, "for making him mayor of New
York."</p>

<p>John snorted his contempt of the statement and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
abettors. The report of Arthur disquieted the Chief and
his counselors, who assembled to hear and discuss it.</p>

<p>"It's regrettable," was Sullivan's opinion. "Livingstone
makes a fine figure in a campaign. He has an attractive
name. His independence is popular, and does no
harm. He hasn't the interests of the party at heart though.
The question now is, can we persuade the Irish to overlook
his peculiarities about the green and St. Patrick's
Day?"</p>

<p>"A more pertinent question," Vandervelt said after a
respectful silence, "would be as to the next available man.
I favor Birmingham."</p>

<p>"And I," echoed the Senator.</p>

<p>Arthur listened to the amicable discussion that followed
with thoughts not for the candidate, but for the three men
who thus determined the history of the city for the next
two years. The triumvirs! Cloudy scenes of half-forgotten
history rose before him, strange names uttered
themselves. Mark Antony and young Octavius and weak
Lepidus! He felt suddenly the seriousness of life, and
wonder at the ways of men; for he had never stood so near
the little gods that harness society to their policies, never
till now had he seen with his own eyes how the world is
steered. The upshot of endless talk and trickery was the
nomination of Birmingham, and the placing of an independent
ticket in the field with the Mayor at its head.</p>

<p>"Now for the fun," said Grahame. "It's going to be
a big fight. If you want to see the working out of principles
keep close to me while the fight is on, and I'll explain
things."</p>

<p>The explanation was intricate and long. What did not
matter he forgot, but the picturesque things, which touched
his own life afterwards very closely, he kept in mind.
Trotting about with the journalist they encountered one
day a cleric of distinguished appearance.</p>

<p>"Take a good look at him. He's the man that steers
Livingstone."</p>

<p>"I thought it was John Everard."</p>

<p>"John doesn't even steer himself," said Grahame savagely.
"But take a view of the bishop."</p>

<p>Arthur saw a face whose fine features were shaded by
melancholy, tinged with jaundice, gloomy in expression;
the mouth drooped at the corners, and the eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
heavy; one could hardly picture that face lighted by
humor or fancy.</p>

<p>"We refuse to discuss certain things in political circles
here," Grahame continued. "One of them is the muddle
made of politics every little while by dragging in religion.
The bishop, Bishop Bradford is his name, never loses a
chance to make a mud pie. The independent ticket is
his pie this year. He secured Livingstone to bake it, for
he's no baker himself. He believes in God, but still more
does he believe that the Catholics of this city should be
kept in the backyard of society. If they eat his pie, their
only ambition will be to live in an American backyard.
No word of this ever finds its way into the journals, but
it is the secret element in New York politics."</p>

<p>"I thought everything got into the newspapers," Arthur
complained. "Blamed if I can get hold of the thing."</p>

<p>"You're right, everything goes into the sewers, but not
in a formal way. What's the reason for the independent
ticket? Printed: revolt against a domineering boss.
Private: to shake the Irish in politics. Do you see?
Now, here is a campaign going on. It began last week.
It ends in November. But the other campaign has neither
beginning nor end. I'll give you object-lessons. There's
where the fun comes in."</p>

<p>The first object-lesson brought Arthur to the gospel-hall
managed by a gentleman whom he had not seen or
thought of since the pleasant celebration of St. Patrick's
day. Rev. Mr. McMeeter, evangelist of the expansive
countenance, was warming up his gathering of sinners
that night with a twofold theme: hell for sinners, and
the same, embroidered intensely, for Rome.</p>

<p>"He handles it as Laocoon did the serpents," whispered
Grahame.</p>

<p>In a very clerical costume, on a small platform, the
earnest man writhed, twisted, and sweated, with every
muscle in strain, his face working in convulsions, his lungs
beating heaven with sound. He outdid the Trojan hero
in the leaps across the platform, the sinuous gestures,
the rendings of the enemy; until that moment when he
drew the bars of hell for the unrepentant, and flung
Rome into the abyss. This effective performance, inartistic
and almost grotesque, never fell to the level of the
ridiculous, for native power was strong in the man. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
peroration raised Livingstone to the skies, chained Sullivan
in the lowest depths of the Inferno, and introduced
as a terrible example a brand just rescued from the burning.</p>

<p>"Study her, observe her," said Grahame. "These
brands have had curious burnings."</p>

<p>She spoke with ease, a little woman in widow's weeds,
coquettishly displaying silken brown hair under the
ruching of a demure bonnet. Taking her own account&mdash;"Which
some reporter wrote for her no doubt," Grahame
commented&mdash;she had been a sinner, a slave of Rome, a
castaway bound hand and foot to degrading superstition,
until rescued by the noblest of men and led by spirit into
the great work of rescuing others from the grinding
slavery of the Church of Rome. Very tenderly she appealed
to the audience to help her. The prayers of the
saints were about to be answered. God had raised up a
leader who would strike the shackles off the limbs of the
children. The leader, of course, was Mayor Livingstone.</p>

<p>"You see how the spirit works," said Grahame.</p>

<p>Then came an interruption. The Brand introduced a
girl of twelve as an illustration of her work of rescue
among the dreadful hirelings of Rome. A feeble and
ragged woman in the audience rose and cried out that the
child was her lost Ellen. The little girl made a leap from
the platform but was caught dexterously by the Brand
and flung behind the scenes. A stout woman shook her
fist in the Brand's face and called her out of her name;
and also gave the evangelist a slap in the stomach which
taught him a new kind of convulsion. His aids fell upon
the stout woman, the tough men of the audience fell upon
the aids, the mother of Ellen began shrieking, and some
respectable people ran to the door to call the police. A
single policeman entered cooly, and laid about him with
his stick so as to hit the evangelists with frequency. For
a few minutes all things turned to dust, confusion, and
bad language. The policeman restored order, dismissed
Ellen with her mother, calmed the stout woman, and cautioned
the host. The Brand had watched the scene
calmly and probably enjoyed it. When Arthur left with
Grahame Mr. McMeeter had just begun an address which
described the policeman as a satellite, a janizary, and
a pretorian of Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're doing a very neat job for Livingstone," said
Grahame. "Maybe there are fifty such places about the
town. Little Ellen was lucky to see her mother again.
Most of these stolen children are shipped off to the west,
and turned into very good Protestants, while their mothers
grieve to death."</p>

<p>"Livingstone ought to be above such work."</p>

<p>"He is. He has nothing in common with a kidnapper
like McMeeter. He just accepts what is thrown at him.
McMeeter throws his support at him. Only high-class
methods attract a man like Livingstone. Sister Claire,
the Escaped Nun, is one of his methods. We'll go and
see her too. She lectures at Chickering Hall to-night ... comes
on about half after nine&mdash;tells all about her escape
from a prison in a convent ... how she was enslaved ... How
sin thrives in convents ... and appeals for help for
other nuns not yet escaped ... with reference to the coming
election and the great deliverer, Livingstone ... makes a
pile of money."</p>

<p>"You seem envious," Arthur hinted.</p>

<p>"Who wouldn't? I can't make a superfluous cent being
virtuous, and Sister Claire clears thousands by lying about
her neighbors."</p>

<p>They took a seat among the reporters, in front of a decorous,
severe, even godly audience, who awaited the coming
of the Escaped Nun with religious interest. Amid a
profound stillness, she came upon the stage from a rear
door, ushered in by an impressive clergyman; and walked
forward, a startling figure, to the speaker's place, where
she stood with the dignity and modesty of her profession,
and a self-possession all her own.</p>

<p>"Stunning," Grahame whispered. "Costume incorrect,
but dramatic."</p>

<p>Her dress and veil were of pale yellow, some woolen
stuff, the coif and gamp were of white linen, and a red
cross marked the entire front of her dress, the arms of the
cross resting on her bosom. Arthur stared. Her face of
a sickly pallor had deep circles under the eyes, but seemed
plump enough for her years. For a moment she stood
quietly, with drooping head and uplifted eyes, her hands
clasped, a picture of beauty. After a gasp and a pause the
audience broke into warm applause long continued. In a
sweet and sonorous voice she made her speech, and told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
story. It sounded like the <i>Lady of the Lake</i> at times.
Grahame yawned&mdash;he had heard it so often. Arthur
gathered that she had somewhere suffered the tortures of
the Inquisition, that innocent girls were enjoying the
same experience in the convents of the country, that they
were deserted both of God and man, and that she alone
had taken up their cause. She was a devoted Catholic,
and could never change her faith; if she appealed to her
audience, it was only to interest them in behalf of her suffering
sisters.</p>

<p>"That's the artistic touch," Grahame whispered again.
"But it won't pay. Her revelations must get more
salaciousness after election."</p>

<p>Arthur hardly heard him. Where had he seen and
heard this woman before? Though he could not recall
a feature of her face, form, dress, manner, yet he had the
puzzling sense of having met her long ago, that her personality
was not unfamiliar. Still her features baffled the
sense. He studied her in vain. When her lecture ended,
with drooping head and clasped hands, she modestly withdrew
amid fervid acclamations.</p>

<p>Strange and bewildering were the currents of intrigue
that made up a campaign in the great city; not to mention
the hidden forces whose current no human could discern.
Arthur went about exercising his talent for oratory in
behalf of Birmingham, and found consolation in the
sincere applause of humble men, and of boys subdued by
the charm of his manner. He learned that the true
orator expresses not only his own convictions and emotions,
but also the unspoken thoughts, the mute feelings, the
cloudy convictions of the simple multitude. He is their
interpreter to themselves. The thought gave him reverence
for that power which had lain long dormant in him
until sorrow waked its noble harmonies. The ferment in
the city astonished him. The very boys fought in the
vacant lots, and reveled in the strategy of crooked
streets and blind alleys. Kindly women, suddenly reminded
that the Irish were a race of slaves, banged their
doors, and flirted their skirts in scorn. Workmen lost their
job here and there, mates fought at the workbench, the
bully found his excuse to beat the weak, all in the name of
Livingstone. The small business men, whose profits came
from both sides, did severe penance for their sins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sanded sugar and deficient weight. The police found their
nerves overstrained.</p>

<p>To him the entire drama of the campaign had the interest
of an impossible romance. It was a struggle between
a poor people, cast out by one nation, fighting for
a footing on new soil, and a successful few, who had forgotten
the sufferings, the similar struggle of their fathers.
He rejoiced when Birmingham won. He had not a single
regret for the defeat of Livingstone, though it hurt him
that a bad cause should have found its leader in his kinsman.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">AN ENDICOTT HEIR.</h3>


<p>Meanwhile what of the world and the woman he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
left behind? A year had passed, his new personality had
begun to fit, and no word or sign direct from the Endicott
circle had reached him. Time seemed to have created a
profound silence between him and them. Indirectly, however,
through the journals, he caught fleeting glimpses of
that rage which had filled Sonia with hatred and despair.
A description of his person appeared as an advertisement,
with a reward of five thousand dollars for information that
would lead to the discovery of his whereabouts, or to a
certainty of his death. At another time the journals which
printed both reward and notice, had a carefully worded
plea from his Aunt Lois for letter or visit to soothe the
anxieties of her last days. He shook over this reminder
of her faithful love until he analyzed the circumstances
which had probably led to this burst of publicity. Early in
July a letter had informed Sonia of his visit to Wisconsin;
two months later a second letter described, in one word,
her character, and in six her sentence: adulteress, you shall
never see me again. A week's work by her lawyers would
have laid bare the fact that the Endicott estate had vanished,
and that her own small income was her sole possession.</p>

<p>A careful study of his motives would have revealed in
part his plans, and a detective had probably spent a month
in a vain pursuit. The detective's report must have
startled even the lawyers. All clues led to nothing. Sonia
had no money to throw away, nor would she dare to appeal
too strongly to Aunt Lois and Horace Endicott's friends,
who might learn too much, if she were too candid. The
two who loved him were not yet really worried by his disappearance,
since they had his significant letter. In time
their confidence would give place to anxiety, and heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and earth would be moved to uncover his hiding-place.
This loving notice was a trap set by Sonia. On the
road which led from Mulberry Street to Cambridge,
from the home of Anne Dillon to the home of Lois Endicott,
Sonia's detective lay in wait for the returning steps
of the lost husband, and Sonia's eyes devoured the shadows,
her ears drank in every sound. He laughed, he grew
warm with the feeling of triumph. She would watch and
listen in vain. The judgment-seat of God was the appointment
he had made for her.</p>

<p>He began now to wonder at the completeness of his own
disappearance. His former self seemed utterly beyond the
reach of men. The detectives had not only failed to find
him, they had not even fallen upon his track by accident.
How singular that an Irish colony in the metropolis should
be so far in fact and sympathy from the aristocracy.
Sonia and her detectives would have thought of Greenland
and the Eskimos, Ashanti, Alaska, the court of China, as
possible refuges, but never of Cherry Street and the children
of Erin, who were farther off from the Endicotts and
the Livingstones than the head-hunters of Borneo. Had
her detectives by any chance met him on the road, prepared
for any disguise, how dumb and deaf and sightless would
they become when his position as the nephew of Senator
Dillon, the secretary of Sullivan, the orator of Tammany
Hall, and the pride of Cherry Hill, shone upon them.</p>

<p>This triumph he would have enjoyed the more could he
have seen the effect which the gradual change in his personality
had produced on Monsignor O'Donnell, for whom
the Endicott episode proved the most curious experience of
his career. Its interest was discounted by the responsibility
imposed upon him. His only comfort lay in the thought
that at any moment he could wash his hands of the affair,
before annoying or dangerous consequences began to
threaten. He suffered from constant misgivings. The
drama of a change in personality went on daily under his
eyes, and almost frightened him by its climaxes, which
were more distinct to him than to Endicott. First, the
pale, worn, savage, and blood-haunted boy who came to
him in his first agony; then the melancholy, bearded, yet
serene invalid who lay in Anne Dillon's house and was
welcomed as her son; next, the young citizen of the Irish
colony, known as a wealthy and lucky Californian, bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ding
for honors as the nephew of Senator Dillon; and
last the surprising orator, the idol of the Irish people,
their devoted friend, who spared neither labor nor money
in serving them.</p>

<p>The awesome things in this process were the fading
away of the Endicott and the growing distinctness of
the Dillon. At first the old personality lay concealed
under the new as under a mask; but something like absorption
by degrees obliterated the outlines of Endicott and
developed the Dillon. Daily he noticed the new features
which sprang into sight between sunrise and sunrise. It
was not only the fashion of dress, of body, and of speech,
which mimics may adopt; but also a change of countenance,
a turn of mind which remained permanent, change
of gesture, a deeper color of skin, greater decision in
movement; in fact, so many and so minute mutations that
he could not recall one-tenth the number. Endicott for instance
had possessed an eloquent, lustrous, round eye,
with an expression delightfully indolent; in Dillon the
roundness and indolence gave way to a malicious wrinkle
at the outside corners, which gave his glance a touch of
bitterness. Endicott had been gracefully slow in his
movement; Dillon was nervous and alert. A fascination
of terror held Monsignor as Arthur Dillon grew like
his namesake more and more. Out of what depths had
this new personality been conjured up? What would be
the end of it? He said to himself that a single incident,
the death of Sonia, would be enough to destroy
on the instant this Dillon and resurrect the Endicott.
Still he was not sure, and the longer this terrible process
continued the less likely a change back to the normal.</p>

<p>Morbid introspection had become a part of the young
man's pain. The study of the changes in himself proved
more pleasant than painful. His mind swung between bitter
depression, and warm, natural joy. His moments of deepest
joy were coincident with an interesting condition of mind.
On certain days he completely forgot the Endicott and became
the Dillon almost perfectly. Then he no longer
acted a part, but was absorbed in it. Most of the time
he was Endicott playing the rôle of Dillon, without effort
and with much pleasure, indeed, but still an actor. When
memory and grief fled from him together, as on St.
Patrick's Day, his new personality dominated each instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of consciousness, and banished thought of the old. Then
a new spirit rose in him; not merely a feeling of relief
from pain, but a positive influence which led him to do
surprising and audacious things, like the speech at the
banquet. It was a divine forgetfulness, which he prayed
might be continuous. He loved to think that some years
of his life would see the new personality in full possession
of him, while the old would be but a feeble memory, a
mere dream of an impossible past. Wonderful, if the
little things of the day, small but innumerable, should
wipe out in the end an entire youth that took twenty
years in building. What is the past after all but a vague
horizon made emphatic by the peaks of memory? What
is the future but a bare plain with no emphasis at all?
Man lives only in the present, like the God whose spirit
breathes in him.</p>

<p>Sonia was bent on his not forgetting, however. His
heart died within him when he read in the journals the
prominent announcement of the birth of a son to the lost
Horace Endicott, whose woful fate still troubled the short
memory of editors. A son! He crushed the paper in his
anguish and fell again into the old depression. Oh, how
thoroughly had God punished the hidden crimes of this
lost woman! A child would have saved her, and in her
hatred of him she had ... he always refused to utter to
himself the thought which here rose before his mind. His
head bent in agony. This child was not his, perhaps not
even hers. She had invented it as a trap for him. Were
it really his little one, his flesh and blood, how eagerly he
would have thrown off his present life and flown to its
rescue from such a mother!</p>

<p>Sonia did not hope for such a result. It was her
fraudulent mortgage on the future and its possibilities.
The child would be heir to his property; would have the
sympathy and inherit the possessions of his Aunt Lois;
would lull the suspicions concerning its mother, and
conciliate the gossips; and might win him back from
hiding, if only to expose the fraud and take shame from
the Endicotts. What a clever and daring criminal was this
woman! With a cleverness always at fault because of her
rare unscrupulousness. Even wickedness has its delicacy,
its modesty, its propriety, which a criminal respects in
proportion to his genius for crime. Sonia offended all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her daring, and lost at every turn. This trap would catch
her own feet. A child! A son! He shuddered at the
thought, and thanked God that he had escaped a new
dishonor. His blood would never mingle with the puddle
in Sonia's veins.</p>

<p>He would not permit her to work this iniquity, and to
check her he must risk final success in his plan of
disappearance by violating the first principle of the art:
that there be no further connection with the past. The
detectives were watching the path by which he would
return, counting perhaps upon his rage over this fraudulent
heir. He must give them their opportunity, if he would
destroy Sonia's schemes against Aunt Lois, but felt sure
that they would be unprepared to seize it, even if they
dreamed it at hand. He had a plan which might accomplish
his object without endangering his position; and
one night he slipped away from the city on a train for
Boston, got off at a lonely station, and plunged into the
darkness without a word for a sleepy station-master.</p>

<p>At dawn after two hours' walk he passed the pond which
had once seemed to him the door of escape. Poor old
friend! Its gray face lay under the morning sky like the
face of a dead saint, luminous in its outlines, as if the glory
of heaven shone through; still, oh, so still, and deep as
if it mirrored immensity. Little complaining murmurs,
like the whimperings of a sleepy child, rose up from the
reeds, sweeter than any songs. He paused an instant to
compare the <i>then</i> and <i>now</i>, but fled with a groan as the
old sorrow, the old madness, suddenly seized him with
the powerful grip of that horrid time. In fact, every step
of the way to Martha's house was torture. He saw that
for him there were other dangers than Sonia and her
detectives, in leaving the refuge which God had provided
for him. Oh, never could he be too grateful for the
blessing, never could he love enough the holy man who
had suggested it, never could he repay the dear souls
whose love had made it beautiful. They rose up before
him as he hurried down the road, the lovable, humorous,
rollicking, faulty clan; and he would not have exchanged
them for the glories of a court, for the joys of Arcady.</p>

<p>The sun and he found Martha busy with household
duties. She did not know him and he said not a word to
enlighten her; he was a messenger from a friend who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
asked of her a service, the carrying of a letter to a certain
woman in Boston; and no one should see her deliver the
letter, or learn her name, or know her coming and going;
for her friend, in hiding, and pursued, must not be discovered.
Then she knew that he came from Horace, and
shed tears that he lived well and happy, but could not
believe, when he had made himself known, that this was
the same man of a year before. They spent a happy day
together in perfecting the details of her visit to Aunt
Lois, which had to be accomplished with great care and
secrecy. There was to be no correspondence between
them. In two weeks he would come again to hear a report
of her success or failure. If she were not at home,
he would come two weeks later. She could tell Aunt
Lois whatever the old lady desired to hear about him, and
assure her that nothing would induce him ever to return
to his former life. The letter said as much. When night
came they went off over the hills together to the nearest railway
station, where he left her to find her way to the city,
while he went on to a different station and took a late train
to New York. By these methods he felt hopeful that his
violation of the rules of disappearing would have no evil
results for him, beyond that momentary return of the old
anguish which had frightened him more than Sonia's detectives.</p>

<p>In four weeks old Martha returned from her mission,
and told this story as they sat in the pleasant kitchen near
a cheery fire.</p>

<p>"I rented a room in the neighborhood of your Aunt
Lois' house, and settled myself to wait for the most
natural opportunity to meet her. It was long in coming,
for she had been sick; but when she got better I saw
her going out to ride, and a little later she took to
walking in the park with her maid. There she often sat,
and chatted with passing children, or with old women like
herself, poor old things trying to get life from the air.
The maid is a spy. She noted every soul about, and had
an extra glance for me when your aunt spoke to me, after I
had waited three weeks for a word. I told her my story,
as I told it to you. She was interested, and I must go to her
house to take lunch with her. I refused. I was not used
to such invitations, but I would call on her at other times.
And the maid listened the more. She was never out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hearing, nor out of sight, until Aunt Lois would get into
a rage, and bid her take a walk. It was then I handed
her the letter under my shawl. The maid's eyes could
not see through the shawl. I told her what you bid me:
that you would never return again, no more than if you
were dead, that she must burn the letter so that none
would know a letter had been received and burned, and
that she would understand many things when she had
read it; most particular that she was surrounded by spies,
and that she must go right on as if nothing had happened,
and deceive as she had been deceived.</p>

<p>"I met her only twice after that. I told her my plan
to deceive the maid. I was a shrewd beggar studying to
get money out of her, with a story about going to my son in
Washington. She bid the maid secretly find out if I was
worthy, and I saw the maid in private, and begged her to
report of me favorably, and she might have half the
money, and then I would go away. And the maid was
deceived, for she brought me fifty dollars from your aunt,
and kept thirty. She would not give even the twenty
until I had promised to go away without complaint. So
I went away, and stayed with a friend in Worcester.
Since I came home I have not seen or heard of any stranger
in this neighborhood. So that it is likely I have not been
suspected or followed. And the letter was burned. And
at the first fair chance your Aunt will go to Europe, taking
with her her two dearest relatives. She called them
Sonia Endicott and her child Horace, and she would keep
them with her while she lived. At the last she sent you
her love, though she could not understand some of the
things you were doing, but that was your own business.
And she never shed a tear, but kept smiling, and her smile
was terrible."</p>

<p>He could believe that. Sonia might as well have lived
in the glare of Vesuvius as in the enlightened smile of
Aunt Lois. The schemer was now in her own toils, and
only at the death of the brave old woman would she know
her failure. Oh, how sweet and great is even human
justice!</p>

<p>"If I do not see you again, Martha," said Arthur as he
kissed the dear old mother farewell, "remember that I
am happy, and that you made me so."</p>

<p>Owen Ledwith had a theory concerning the invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of Ireland, which he began to expound that winter. Since
few know much more about the military art than the firing
of a shotgun, he won the scorn of all except his daughter
and Arthur Dillon. In order to demonstrate his theory
Ledwith was willing to desert journalism, to fit out a
small ship, and to sail into an Irish harbor from New
York and back, without asking leave from any government;
if only the money were supplied by the patriots to
buy the ship and pay the sailors. His theory held that
a fleet of many ships might sail unquestioned from the
unused harbors of the American coast, and land one hundred
thousand armed men in Ireland, where a blow might
be struck such as never had been yet in the good cause.
Military critics denied the possibility of such an invasion.
He would have liked to perform the feat with a single
ship, to convince them.</p>

<p>"I have a suspicion," he said one night to his daughter,
"that this young Dillon would give me five thousand dollars
for the asking. He is a Fenian now."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" Honora cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see any reason for wonder, Nora. He
has been listening to me for three months, vaporing over
the wrongs of Ireland; he's of Celtic blood; he has been
an adventurer in California; he has the money, it would
seem. Why, the wonder would be if he did not do what
all the young fellows are doing."</p>

<p>"I have not quite made up my mind about him yet,
father," the young woman said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He's all man," said the father.</p>

<p>"True, but a man who is playing a part."</p>

<p>He laid down his pipe in his surprise, but she smiled
assuringly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it's fine acting, if you call it so, my love. In
a little over a year he has made himself the pride of
Cherry Hill. Your great friend,"&mdash;this with a sniff&mdash;"Monsignor
O'Donnell, is his sponsor. He speaks like
the orator born and with sincerity, though he knows little
of politics. But he has ideas. Then did you ever meet
a merrier lad? Such a singer and dancer, such a favorite
among boys and girls! He seems to be as lovable as his
uncle the Senator, and the proof of it is that all confide
in him. However, I have faith in your instincts, Nora.
What do they say?"</p>

<p>"He looks at us all like a spectator sitting in front of
a stage. Of course I have heard the people talk about
him. He is a popular idol, except to his mother who
seems to be afraid of him. He has moods of sadness,
gloom, and Miss Conyngham told me she would wager he
left a wife in California. While all like him, each one
has a curious thing to tell about him. They all say it is
the sickness which he had on coming home, and that the
queer things are leaving him. The impression he gives
me is that of one acting a part. I must say it is fading
every day, but it hinders me from feeling quite satisfied
about him."</p>

<p>"Well, one thing is in his favor: he listens to me,"
said Ledwith. "He is one of the few men to whom I am
not a crazy dreamer, crazy with love of Erin and hate of
her shameless foe."</p>

<p>"And I love him for that, father," she said tenderly.
"There is no acting in his regard and esteem for you,
nothing insincere in his liking for us, even if we cannot
quite understand it. For we <i>are</i> queer, Daddy," putting
her arms about him. "Much love for our old home and
much thinking how to help it, and more despair and
worry, have shut us off from the normal life, until we
have forgotten the qualities which make people liked.
Poor Daddy!"</p>

<p>"Better that than doing nothing," he said sadly.
"To struggle and fight once in a while mean living; to
sit still would be to die."</p>

<p>Arthur was ushered in just then by the servant, and
took his place comfortably before the fire. One could
see the regard which they felt for him; on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Ledwith it was almost affection. Deeply and sincerely
he returned their kindly feeling.</p>

<p>He had a host of reasons for his regard. Their position
seemed as strange to the humdrum world as his own.
They were looked on as queer people, who lived outside
the ruts for the sake of an enslaved nation. The idea
of losing three meals a day and a fixed home for a hopeless
cause tickled the humor of the practical. Their devotion
to an idea hardly surpassed their devotion to each other.
He mourned for her isolation, she mourned over his failures
to free his native land.</p>

<p>"I have almost given the cause up," he said once to
Arthur, "because I feel my helplessness. I cannot agree
with the leaders nor they with me. But if I gave up she
would worry herself to death over my loss of hope. I
keep on, half on her account, half in the hope of striking
the real thing at the end."</p>

<p>"It seems to be also the breath of her life," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"No, it is not," the father replied. "Have you not
heard her talk of your friend, Louis Everard? How she
dwells on his calling, and the happiness of it! My poor
child, her whole heart yearns for the cloister. She loves
all such things. I have urged her to follow her inclinations,
though I know it would be the stroke of death for
me, but she will not leave me until I die."</p>

<p>"You must not take us too seriously," she had once said,
"in this matter of Irish liberties. My father is hopelessly
out of the current, for his health is only fair, and he has
quarreled with his leaders. I have given up hope of
achieving anything. But if he gives up he dies. So, I
encourage him and keep marching on, in spite of the bitterest
disappointments. Perhaps something may come of
it in the end."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it," said Arthur, uttering a great
thought. "Every tear, every thought, every heart-throb,
every drop of sweat and blood, expended for human liberty,
must be gathered up by God and laid away in the treasury
of heaven. The despots of time shall pay the interest of
that fund here or there."</p>

<p>A woman whose ideals embraced the freedom of an oppressed
people, devotion to her father, and love for the
things of God, would naturally have a strong title to the
respect of Arthur Dillon; and she was, besides, a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
woman, who spoke great things in a voice so sweetly responsive
to her emotions that father and friend listened
as to music. The Ledwiths had a comfortable income,
when they set to work, earned by his clever pen and her
exquisite voice. The young man missed none of her
public appearances, though he kept the fact to himself.
She was on those occasions the White Lady in earnest.
Her art had warmth indeed, but the coldness and aloofness
of exalted purity put her beyond the zone of desire;
a snowy peak, distinct to the eye, but inaccessible. When
they were done with greetings Arthur brought up a specific
subject.</p>

<p>"It has gone about that I have become a Fenian," he
said, "and I have been called on to explain to many what
chance the movement has of succeeding. There was
nothing in the initiation which gave me that information."</p>

<p>"You can say: none," Ledwith answered bitterly.
"And if you quote me as your authority there will be
many new members in the brotherhood."</p>

<p>"Then why keep up the movement, if nothing is to
come of it?"</p>

<p>"The fighting must go on," Ledwith replied, "from
generation to generation in spite of failure. The Fenian
movement will fail like all its predecessors. The only
reason for its continuance is that its successor may succeed.
Step by step! Few nations are as lucky as this
to win in the first fight. Our country is the unluckiest of
all. Her battle has been on seven hundred years."</p>

<p>"But I think there must be more consolation in the
fight than your words imply;" Arthur declared. "There
must be a chance, a hope of winning."</p>

<p>"The hope has never died but the chance does not yet
exist, and there is no chance for the Fenians," Ledwith
answered with emphasis. "The consolation lies for
most of us in keeping up the fight. It is a joy to
let our enemy, England, know, and to make her feel,
that we hate her still, and that our hate keeps pace with
her advancing greatness. It is pleasant to prove to her,
even by an abortive rising, that all her crimes, rogueries,
and diplomacies against us have been vain to quench
our hate. We have been scattered over the world, but
our hate has been intensified. It is joy to see her foam at
the mouth like a wild beast, then whine to the world over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the ingratitude of the Irish; to hear the representatives of
her tax-payers howl in Parliament at the expense of putting
down regular rebellions; to see the landlords flying
out of the country they have ravaged, and the Orangemen
white with the fear of slaughter. Then these movements
are an education. The children are trained to a knowledge
of the position, to hatred of the English power, and
their generation takes up the fight where the preceding
left it."</p>

<p>"Hate is a terrible thing," said the young man. "Is
England so hateful then?"</p>

<p>Honora urged him by looks to change the subject, for
her father knew no bounds in speaking of his country's
enemy, but he would not lift his eyes to her face. He
wished to hear Owen Ledwith express his feelings with
full vent on the dearest question to his heart. The man
warmed up as he spoke, fire in his eyes, his cheeks, his
words, and gestures.</p>

<p>"She is a fiend from hell," he replied, hissing the words
quietly. Deep emotion brought exterior calm to Ledwith.
"But that is only a feeling of mine. Let us deal
with the facts. Like the fabled vampire England hangs
upon the throat of Ireland, battening on her blood.
Populous England, vanishing Ireland! What is the meaning
of it? One people remains at home by the millions,
the other flies to other lands by the millions. Because
the hell-witch is good to her own. For them the trade of
the world, the opening of mines, the building of factories,
the use of every natural power, the coddling of every
artificial power. They go abroad only to conquer and tax
the foreigner for the benefit of those at home. Their harbors
are filled with ships, and their treasury with the gold
of the world. For our people, there is only permission to
work the soil, for the benefit of absentee landlords, or
encouragement to depart to America. No mines, no
factories, no commerce, no harbors, no ships, in a word
no future. So the Irish do not stay at home. The laws
of England accomplished this destruction of trade, of art,
of education, oh, say it at once, of life. Damnable laws,
fashioned by the horrid greed of a rich people, that could
not bear to see a poor people grow comfortable. They
called over to their departments of trade, of war, of art,
to court, camp, and studio, our geniuses, gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fame, and dubbed them Englishmen; the castaways, the
Irish in America and elsewhere are known as 'the mere
Irish.'"</p>

<p>"It is very bitter," said Arthur, seeing the unshed
tears in Honora's eyes.</p>

<p>"I wonder how we bear it," Ledwith continued. "We
have not the American spirit, you may be sure. I can
fancy the colonists of a hundred years back meeting an
Irish situation; the men who faced the Indian risings,
and, worse, the subduing of the wilderness. For them it
would have been equal rights and privileges and chances,
or the bottom of the sea for one of the countries. But we
are poetic and religious, and murderous only when a
Cromwell or a Castlereagh opens hell for us. However,
the past is nothing; it is the present which galls us. The
gilding of the gold and the painting of the lily are symbols
of our present sufferings. After stripping and roasting
us at home, this England, this hell-witch sends
abroad into all countries her lies and slanders about us.
Her spies, her professors, her gospellers, her agents, her
sympathizers everywhere, can tell you by the yard of our
natural inferiority to the Chinese. Was it not an American
bishop who protested in behalf of the Chinese of San
Francisco that they were more desirable immigrants than
the sodden Irish? God! this clean, patient, laborious
race, whose chastity is notorious, whose Christianity has
withstood the desertion of Christ&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Honora gave a half scream at the blasphemy, but at
once controlled herself.</p>

<p>"I take that back, child&mdash;it was only madness," Ledwith
said. "You see, Dillon, how scarred my soul is with
this sorrow. But the bishop and the Chinese! Not a
word against that unfortunate people, whose miseries are
greater even than ours, and spring from the same sources.
At least <i>they</i> are not lied about, and a bishop, forsooth!
can compare them, pagans in thought and act and habit
though they be, with the most moral and religious people
in the world, to his own shame. It is the English lie
working. The Irish are inferior, and of a low, groveling,
filthy nature; they are buried both in ignorance and
superstition; their ignorance can be seen in their hatred
of British rule, and their refusal to accept the British
religion; wherever they go in the wide world, they reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the average of decency and intelligence and virtue; for
twenty years these lies have been sung in the ears of the
nations, until only the enemies of England have a welcome
for us. Behold our position in this country. Just
tolerated. No place open to us except that of cleaning
the sewers. Every soul of us compelled to fight, as Birmingham
did the other day, for a career, and to fight against
men like Livingstone, who should be our friends. And
in the hearts of the common people a hatred for us, a disgust,
even a horror, not inspired by the leprous Chinese.
We have earned all this hatred and scorn and opposition
from England, because in fighting with her we have observed
the laws of humanity, when we should have wiped
her people off the face of the earth as Saul smote Agag
and his corrupt people, as Cromwell treated us. Do you
wonder that I hate this England far more than I hate sin,
or the devil, or any monstrous creature which feeds upon
man."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder," said Arthur. "With you there
is always an increasing hatred of England?"</p>

<p>"Until death," cried Ledwith, leaping from his seat, as
if the fire of hate tortured him, and striding about the
room. "To fight every minute against this monster, to
fight in every fashion, to irritate her, to destroy a grain of
her influence, in a single mind, in a little community, to
expose her pretense, her sham virtues, her splendid hypocrisy,
these are the breath of my life. That hate will
never perish until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused as if in painful thought, and passed his hand
over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Until the wrongs of centuries have been avenged,"
said Arthur. Ledwith sat down with a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"That's a sentence from the orations of our patriotic
orators," he sneered. "What have we to do with the
past? It is dead. The oppressed and injured are dead.
God has settled their cause long ago. It would be a pretty
and consoling sight to look at the present difference between
the English Dives and the Irish Lazarus! The
vengeance of God is a terrible thing. No! my hate is of
the present. It will not die until we have shaken the
hold of this vampire, until we have humiliated and disgraced
it, and finally destroyed it. I don't speak of retaliation.
The sufferings of the innocent and oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
are not atoned for by the sufferings of other innocents and
other oppressed. The people are blameless. The leaders,
the accursed aristocracy of blood, of place, of money,
these make the corporate vampire, which battens upon
the weak and ignorant poor; only in England they give
them a trifle more, flatter them with skill, while the Irish
are kicked out like beggars."</p>

<p>He looked at Dillon with haggard eyes. Honora sat
like a statue, as if waiting for the storm to pass.</p>

<p>"I have not sworn an oath like Hannibal," he said,
"because God cannot be called as a witness to hate. But
the great foe of Rome never observed his oath more faithfully
than I shall that compact which I have made with
myself and the powers of my nature: to turn all my
strength and time and capacity into the channel of hate
against England. Oh, how poor are words and looks and
acts to express that fire which rages in the weakest and
saddest of men."</p>

<p>He sank back with a gesture of weariness, and found
Honora's hand resting on his tenderly.</p>

<p>"The other fire you have not mentioned, Daddy," she
said wistfully, "the fire of a love which has done more
for Erin than the fire of hate. For love is more than
hate, Daddy."</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed," he admitted. "Much as I hate England,
what is it to my love for her victim? Love is more
than hate. One destroys, the other builds."</p>

<p>Ledwith, quite exhausted by emotion, became silent.
The maid entered with a letter, which Honora opened,
read silently, and handed to her father without comment.
His face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Doyle Grahame writes me," he explained to Arthur,
"that a friend, who wishes to remain unknown, has contributed
five thousand dollars to testing my theory of an
invasion of Ireland. That makes the expedition a certainty&mdash;for
May."</p>

<p>"Then let me volunteer the first for this enterprise,"
said Arthur blithely.</p>

<p>"And me the second," cried Honora with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Accepted both," said Ledwith, with a proud smile, new
life stealing into his veins.</p>

<p>Not for a moment did he suspect the identity of his
benefactor, until Monsignor, worried over the risk for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Arthur came to protest some days later. The priest had
no faith in the military enterprise of the Fenians, and, if
he smiled at Arthur's interest in conspiracy, saw no good
reasons why he should waste his money and expose his
life and liberty in a feeble and useless undertaking. His
protest both to Arthur and others was vigorous.</p>

<p>"If you have had anything to do with making young
Dillon a Fenian," he said, "and bringing him into this
scheme of invasion, Owen, I would like you to undo the
business, and persuade him to stay at home."</p>

<p>"Which I shall not do, you may be sure, Monsignor,"
replied the patriot politely. "I want such men. The
enemy we fight sacrifices the flower of English youth to
maintain its despotism; why should we shrink from
sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"I do not speak of sacrifice," said Monsignor. "One
man is the same as another. But there are grave reasons
which demand the presence of this young man in America,
and graver reasons why he should not spend his money
incautiously."</p>

<p>"Well, he has not spent any money yet, so far as I
know," Ledwith said.</p>

<p>The priest hesitated a moment, while the other looked
at him curiously.</p>

<p>"You are not aware, then, that he has provided the
money for your enterprise?" Honora uttered a cry, and
Ledwith sprang from his chair in delighted surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you tell me that?" he shouted. "Honora,
Honora, we have found the right man at last! Oh, I felt
a hundred times that this young fellow was destined to
work immense good for me and mine. God bless him
forever and ever."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Honora, rejoicing in her father's joy.</p>

<p>"You know my opinion on these matters, Owen," said
Monsignor.</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed, and of all the priests for that matter.
Had we no religion the question of Irish freedom would
have been settled long ago. Better for us had we been
pagans or savages. Religion teaches us only how to
suffer and be slaves."</p>

<p>"And what has patriotism done for you?" Monsignor
replied without irritation.</p>

<p>"Little enough, to be sure."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, since I have told you how necessary it is that
Dillon should remain in America, and that his money
should not be expended&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monsignor," Ledwith broke in impatiently, "let me
say at once you are asking what you shall not get. I swear
to you that if the faith which you preach depended on
getting this young fellow to take back his money and to
desert this enterprise, that faith would die. I want men,
and I shall take the widow's only son, the father of the
family, the last hope of a broken heart. I want money,
and I shall take the crust from the mouth of the starving,
the pennies from the poor-box, the last cent of the poor,
the vessels of the altar, anything and everything, for my
cause. How many times has our struggle gone down in
blood and shame because we let our foolish hearts, with
their humanity, their faith, their sense of honor, their
ridiculous pride, rule us. I want this man and his money.
I did not seek them, and I shall not play tricks to keep
them. But now that they are mine, no man shall take
them from me."</p>

<p>Honora made peace between them, for these were stubborn
men, unwilling to make compromises. Monsignor
could give only general reasons. Ledwith thought God
had answered his prayers at last. They parted with equal
determination.</p>

<p>What a welcome Arthur Dillon received from the Ledwiths
on his next visit! The two innocents had been
explaining their ideas for years, and traveling the earth
to put them into action; and in all that time had not
met a single soul with confidence enough to invest a dollar
in them. They had spent their spare ducats in attempting
what required a bank to maintain. They had endured
the ridicule of the hard-hearted and the silent pity of the
friends who believed them foolish dreamers. And behold
a man of money appears to endow their enterprise, and
to show his faith in it by shipping as a common member
of the expedition. Was there ever such luck? They
thanked him brokenly, and looked at him with eyes so
full of tenderness and admiration and confidence, that
Arthur swore to himself he would hereafter go about the
earth, hunting up just such tender creatures, and providing
the money to make their beautiful, heroic, and foolish
dreams come true. He began to feel the truth of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
philosopher's saying: the dreams of the innocent are the
last reasoning of sages.</p>

<p>"And to this joy is added another," said Ledwith,
when he could speak steadily. "General Sheridan has
promised to lead a Fenian army the moment the Irish
government can show it in the field."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"What does it mean that an Irish army on Irish soil
should have for its leader a brilliant general like Sheridan?"
cried Ledwith. A new emotion overpowered him.
His eyes filled with tears. "It means victory for a forlorn
cause. Napoleon himself never led more devoted
troops than will follow that hero to battle. Washington
never received such love and veneration as he will from
the poor Irish, sick with longing for a true leader. Oh,
God grant the day may come, and that we may see it,
when that man will lead us to victory."</p>

<p>His eyes flashed fire. He saw that far-off future, the
war with its glories, the final triumph, the crowning of
Sheridan with everlasting fame. And then without warning
he suddenly fell over into a chair. Arthur lifted up
his head in a fright, and saw a pallid face and lusterless
eyes. Honora bathed his temples, with the coolness and
patience of habit.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, nothing," he said feebly after a moment.
"Only the foolishness of it all ... I can forget like a boy
... the thing will never come to pass ... never, never,
never! There stands the hero, splendid with success, rich
in experience, eager, willing, a demigod whom the Irish
could worship ... his word would destroy faction, wipe out
treason, weed out fools, hold the clans in solid union ... if
we could give him an army, back him with a government,
provide him with money! We shall never have the army
... nothing. Treason breeding faction, faction inviting
treason ... there's our story. O, God, ruling in heaven,
but not on earth, why do you torture us so? To give us
such a man, and leave us without the opportunity or the
means of using him!"</p>

<p>He burst into violent, silent weeping. Dillon felt the
stab of that hopeless grief, which for the moment revived
his own, although he could not quite understand it.
Ledwith dashed away the tears after a little and spoke
calmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see how I can yield to dreams like a foolish child.
I felt for a little as if the thing had come to pass, and
gave in to the fascination. This is the awaking. All
the joy and sorrow of my life have come mostly from
dreams."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ANNE DILLON'S FELICITY.</h3>


<p>Monsignor was not discouraged by his failure to detach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Arthur from the romantic expedition to the Irish
coast. With a view to save him from an adventure so
hurtful to his welfare, he went to see Anne Dillon. Her
home, no longer on Mulberry Street, but on the confines of
Washington Square, in a modest enough dwelling, enjoyed
that exclusiveness which is like the atmosphere of a great
painting. One feels by instinct that the master hand
has been here. Although aware that good fortune had
wrought a marked change in Anne, Monsignor was utterly
taken aback by a transformation as remarkable in its way
as the metamorphosis of Horace Endicott.</p>

<p>Judy Haskell admitted him, and with a reverence
showed him into the parlor; the same Judy Haskell as of
yore, ornamented with a lace cap, a collar, deep cuffs,
and an apron; through which her homeliness shone as
defiantly as the face of a rough mountain through the fog.
She had been instructed in the delicate art of receiving
visitors with whom her intimacy had formerly been marked;
but for Monsignor she made an exception, and the glint
in her eye, the smile just born in the corner of her emphatic
mouth, warned him that she knew of the astonishment
which his good breeding concealed.</p>

<p>"We're mountin' the laddher o' glory," she said, after
the usual questions. "Luk at me in me ould age, dhressed
out like a Frinch sportin' maid. If there was a baby in
the house ye'd see me, Father Phil, galivantin' behind a
baby-carriage up an' down the Square. Faith, she does it
well, the climbin', if we don't get dizzy whin we're halfway
up, an' come to earth afore all the neighbors, flatter
nor pancakes."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Monsignor, "are you not as good as
the best, with the blood of the Montgomerys and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Haskells in your veins? Are you to make strange with
all this magnificence, as if you were Indians seeing it for
the first time?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've been sayin' to meself since it began,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Since what began?"</p>

<p>"Why, the changin' from Mulberry Sthreet Irish to
Washington Square Yankees," Judy said with a shade of
asperity. "It began wid the dog-show an' the opera.
Oh, but I thought I'd die wid laughin', whin I had to
shtan' at the doors o' wan place or the other, waitin' on
Micksheen, or listenin' to the craziest music that ever was
played or sung. After that kem politics, an' nothin' wud
do her but she'd bate ould Livingstone for Mare all by herself.
Thin it was Vandervelt for imbassador to England,
an' she gev the Senator an' the Boss no pace till they tuk
it up. An' now it's the Countess o' Skibbereen mornin',
noon, an' night. I'm sick o' that ould woman. But she
owns the soul of Anne Dillon."</p>

<p>"Well, her son can afford it," said Monsignor affably.
"Why shouldn't she enjoy herself in her own way?"</p>

<p>"Thrue for you, Father Phil; I ought to call you
Morrisania, but the ould names are always the shweetest.
He has the money, and he knows how to spind it, an' if
he didn't she'd show him. Oh, but he's the fine b'y!
Did ye ever see annywan grow more an' more like his
father, pace to his ashes. Whin he first kem it wasn't so
plain, but now it seems to me he's the very spit o' Pat
Dillon. The turn of his head is very like him."</p>

<p>At this point in a chat, which interested Monsignor
deeply, a soft voice floated down from the upper distance,
calling, "Judy! Judy!" in a delicate and perfect French
accent.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear that, Father Phil?" whispered Judy with
a grin. "It's nothin' now but Frinch an' a Frinch masther.
Wait till yez hear me at it."</p>

<p>She hastened to the hall and cried out, "Oui, oui,
Madame," with a murmured aside to the priest, "It's all
I know."</p>

<p>"Venez en haut, Judy," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Oui, oui, Madame," answered Judy. "That manes
come up, Father Phil," and Judy walked off upright,
with folded arms, swinging her garments, actions belied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
by the broad grin on her face, and the sarcastic motion of
her lips, which kept forming the French words with great
scorn.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterward Anne glided into the room.
The Montgomery girls had all been famous for their
beauty in the earlier history of Cherry Hill, and Anne
had been the belle of her time. He remembered her
thirty years back, on the day of her marriage, when he
served as altar-boy at her wedding; and recalled a sweet-faced
girl, with light brown silken hair, languorous blue
eyes, rose-pink skin, the loveliest mouth, the most provoking
chin. Time and sorrow had dealt harshly with her,
and changed her, as the fairies might, into a thin-faced,
gray-haired, severe woman, whose dim eyes were hidden
by glasses. She had retained only her grace and dignity
of manner. He recalled all this, and drew his breath;
for before him stood Anne Montgomery, as she had stood
before him at the altar; allowing that thirty years had
artistically removed the youthful brilliance of youth, but
left all else untouched. The brown hair waved above her
forehead, from her plump face most of the wrinkles had
disappeared, her eyes gleamed with the old time radiance,
spectacles had been banished, a subdued color tinted her
smiling face.</p>

<p>"Your son is not the only one to astound me," said
Monsignor. "Anne, you have brought back your youth
again. What a magician is prosperity."</p>

<p>"It's the light-heartedness, Monsignor. To have as
much money as one can use wisely and well, to be done
with scrimpin' forever, gives wan a new heart, or a new
soul. I feel as I felt the day I was married."</p>

<p>She might have added some information as to the share
which modiste and beautifier might claim in her rejuvenation,
but Monsignor, very strict and happily ignorant of
the details of the toilet, as an ecclesiastic should be, was
lost in admiration of her. It took him ten minutes to
come to the object of his visit.</p>

<p>"He has long been ahead of you," she said, referring
to Arthur. "I asked him for leave to visit Ireland, and
he gave it on two conditions: that I would take Louis and
Mona wid me, and refuse to interfere with this Fenian
business, no matter who asked me. I was so pleased that
I promised, and of course I can't go back on me word."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a very clever young man," said Monsignor,
admiring Anne's skill in extinguishing her beautiful
brogue, which, however, broke out sweetly at times.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the like of him?" she exclaimed.
"I'm afraid of him. He begins to look like himself and
like his father ... glory be to God ... just from looking at
the pictures of the two and thinkin' about them. He's
good and generous, but I have never got over being afeared
of him. It was only when he went back on his uncle ...
on Senator Dillon ... that I plucked up courage to face
him. I had the Senator all ready to take the place which
Mr. Birmingham has to-day, when Arthur called him off."</p>

<p>"He never could have been elected, Anne."</p>

<p>"I never could see why. The people that said that
didn't think Mr. Vandervelt could be made ambassador
to England, at least this time. But he kem so near it that
Quincy Livingstone complimented me on my interest for
Mr. Vandervelt. And just the same, Dan Dillon would
have won had he run for the office. It was with him a
case of not wantin' to be de trop."</p>

<p>"Your French is três propos, Anne," said Monsignor
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"If you want to hear an opinion of it," said the clever
woman, laughing, too, "go and hear the complaints of
Mary and Sister Magdalen. Mais je suis capable de parler
Français tout de même."</p>

<p>"And are you still afraid of Arthur? Wouldn't you
venture on a little protest against his exposing himself to
needless danger?"</p>

<p>"I can do that, certainement, but no more. I love him,
he's so fine a boy, and I wish I could make free wid him;
but he terrifies me when I think of everything and look
at him. More than wanst have I seen Arthur Dillon looking
out at me from his eyes; and sometimes I feel that
Pat is in the room with me when he is around. As I
said, I got courage to face him, and he was grieved that I
had to. For he went right into the contest over Vandervelt,
and worked beautifully for the Countess of Skibbereen.
I'm to dine with her at the Vandervelts' next
week, the farewell dinner."</p>

<p>Her tones had a velvet tenderness in uttering this last
sentence. She had touched one of the peaks of her ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall meet you there," said Monsignor, taking a
pinch of snuff. "Anne, you're a wonderful woman.
How have all these wonders come about?"</p>

<p>"It would take a head like your own to tell," she answered,
with a meaning look at her handsome afternoon
costume. "But I know some of the points of the game.
I met Mr. Vandervelt at a reception, and told him he
should not miss his chance to be ambassador, even if
Livingstone lost the election and wanted to go to England
himself. Then he whispered to me the loveliest whisper.
Says he, 'Mrs. Dillon, they think it will be a good way to
get rid of Mr. Livingstone if he's defeated,' says he; 'but
if he wins I'll never get the high place, says he, 'for Tammany
will be of no account for years.'"</p>

<p>Anne smiled to herself with simple delight over that
whispered confidence of a Vandervelt, and Monsignor sat
admiring this dawning cleverness. He noticed for the
first time that her taste in dress was striking and perfect,
as far as he could judge.</p>

<p>"'Then' says I, 'Mr. Vandervelt,' says I, 'there's only
wan thing to be done, wan thing to be done,' says I.
'Arthur and the Senator and Doyle Grahame and Monsignor
must tell Mr. Sullivan along wid Mr. Birmingham
that you should go to England this year. 'Oh,' said he, 'if
you can get such influence to work, nothing will stop me
but the ill-will of the President.' 'And even there,' said I,
'it will be paving the way for the next time, if you make a
good showing this time.' 'You see very far and well,' said
he. That settled it. I've been dinin' and lunching with
the Vandervelts ever since. You know yourself, Monsignor,
how I started every notable man in town to tell
Mr. Sullivan that Vandervelt must go to England. We
failed, but it was the President did it; but he gave Mr.
Vandervelt his choice of any other first-class mission.
Then next, along came the old Countess of Skibbereen,
and she was on the hands of the Vandervelts with her
scheme of getting knitting-machines for the poor people of
Galway. She wasn't getting on a bit, for she was old and
queer in her ways, and the Vandervelts were worried over it.
Then I said: 'why not get up a concert, and have Honora
sing and let Tammany take up one end and society the
other, and send home the Countess with ten thousand
dollars?' My dear, they jumped at it, and the Countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
jumped at me. Will you ever forget it, Monsignor dear,
the night that Honora sang as the Genius of Erin? If
that girl could only get over her craziness for Ireland and
her father&mdash;but that's not what I was talking about. Well,
the Countess has her ten thousand dollars, and says I'm
the best-dressed woman in New York. So, that's the way
I come to dine with the Vandervelts at the farewell dinner
to the Countess, and when it comes off New York will be
ringing with the name of Mrs. Montgomery Dillon."</p>

<p>"Is that the present name?" said Monsignor. "Anne,
if you go to Ireland you'll return with a title. Your son
should be proud of you."</p>

<p>"I'll give him better reason before I'm done, Monsignor."</p>

<p>The prelate rose to go, then hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is anything?&mdash;do you think there
could be anything with regard to Honora Ledwith?"</p>

<p>She stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"I have watched all that. Not a thing could happen.
Her thoughts are in heaven, poor child, and his are busy
with some woman that bothered him long ago, and may
have a claim on him. No wan told me, but my seein' and
hearing are sharp as ever."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mrs. Montgomery Dillon," he said, bowing
at the door.</p>

<p>"Au plaisir, Monseigneur," she replied with a curtsey,
and Judy opened the outer door, face and mien like an
Egyptian statue of the twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p>Anne Dillon watched him go with a sigh of deep contentment.
How often she had dreamed of men as distinguished
leaving her presence and her house in this fashion; and the
dream had come true. All her life she had dreamed of the
elegance and importance, which had come to her through
her strange son, partly through her own ambition and ability.
She now believed that if one only dreams hard enough
fortune will bring dreams true. As the life which is past
fades, for all its reality, into the mist-substance of dreams,
why should not the reverse action occur? Had she been
without the rich-colored visions which illuminated her
idle hours, opportunity might have found her a spiritless
creature, content to take a salary from her son and to lay
it by for the miserable days of old age. Out upon such
tameness! She had found life in her dreams, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
highest expressions of that life were Mrs. Montgomery
Dillon and the Dowager Countess of Skibbereen.</p>

<p>As a pagan priestess might have arrayed herself for appearance
in the sanctuary, she clothed herself in purple
and gold on the evening of the farewell dinner.</p>

<p>Arthur escorted his mother and Honora to the Vandervelt
residence.</p>

<p>As the trio made their bows, the aspirant for diplomatic
honors rejoiced that his gratitude for real favors reflected
itself in objects so distinguished. He was a grateful man,
this Vandervelt, and broad-minded, willing to gild the
steps by which he mounted, and to honor the humblest
who honored him: an aristocrat in the American sense
of the term, believing that those who wished should be
encouraged to climb as high as natural capacity and opportunity
permitted. The party sat down slightly bored,
they had gone through it so often; but for Anne Dillon
each moment and each circumstance shone with celestial
beauty. She floated in the ether. The mellow lights, the
glitter of silver and glass, the perfume of flowers, the soft
voices, all sights and sounds, made up a harmony which
lifted her body from the ground as on wings, more like a
dream than her richest dreams. For conversation, some
one started Lord Constantine on his hobby, and said
Arthur was a Fenian, bent on destroying the hobby forever.
In the discussion the Countess appealed to
Anne.</p>

<p>"We are a fighting race," said she, with admirable
caution picking her steps through a long paragraph.
"There's&mdash;there are times when no one can hold us. This
is such a time. A few months back the Fenian trouble
could have been settled in one week. Now it will take a
year."</p>

<p>"But how?" said Vandervelt. "If you had the making
of the scheme, I'm sure it would be a success."</p>

<p>"In this way," she answered, bowing and smiling to his
sincere compliment, "by making all the Irish Fenians,
that is, those in Ireland, policemen."</p>

<p>The gentlemen laughed with one accord.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sullivan manages his troublesome people that
way," she observed triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You are a student of the leader," said Vandervelt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everybody should study him, if they want to win,"
said Anne.</p>

<p>"And that's wisdom," cried Lord Constantine.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on opera, and the hostess
wondered why Honora did not study for the operatic stage.
Then they all urged her to think of the scheme.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Anne gently, "that she will never try
to spoil her voice with opera. The great singers give me
the chills, and the creeps, and the shivers, the most terrible
feeling, which I never had since the day Monsignor
preached his first sermon, and broke down."</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear creature," cried the Countess, "what a
long memory you have."</p>

<p>Monsignor had to explain his first sermon. So it went
on throughout the dinner. The haze of perfect happiness
gathered about Anne, and her speech became inspired.
A crown of glory descended upon her head when the
Dowager, hearing of her summer visit to Ireland with
Mona and Louis in her care, exacted a solemn promise from
her that the party should spend one month with her at
Castle Moyna, her dower home.</p>

<p>"That lovely boy and girl," said the Countess, "will
find the place pleasant, and will make it pleasant for me;
where usually I can induce not even my son's children to
come, they find it so dull."</p>

<p>It did not matter much to Anne what happened thereafter.
The farewells, the compliments, the joy of walking
down to the coach on the arm of Vandervelt, were as
dust to this invitation of the Dowager Countess of Skibbereen.
The glory of the dinner faded away. She looked
down on the Vandervelts from the heights of Castle Moyna.
She lost all at once her fear of her son. From that moment
the earth became as a rose-colored flame. She almost
ignored the adulation of Cherry Hill, and the astonished
reverence of her friends over her success. Her
success was told in awesome whispers in the church as she
walked to the third pew of the middle aisle. A series of
legends grew about it, over which the experienced gossips
disputed in vain; her own description of the dinner was
carried to the four quarters of the world by Sister Magdalen,
Miss Conyngham, Senator Dillon, and Judy; the
skeptical and envious pretended to doubt even the paragraph
in the journals. At last they were struck dumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with the rest when it was announced that on Saturday
last Mrs. Montgomery Dillon, Miss Mona Everard, and
Mr. Louis Everard had sailed on the City of London for
a tour of Europe, the first month of which would be
spent at Castle Moyna, Ireland, as guests of the Dowager
Countess of Skibbereen!</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ABOARD THE "ARROW."</h3>


<p>One month later sailed another ship. In the depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
night the <i>Arrow</i> slipped her anchor, and stole away from
the suspicious eyes of harbor officials into the Atlantic;
a stout vessel, sailed with discretion, her trick being to
avoid no encounters on the high seas and to seek none.
Love and hope steered her course. Her bowsprit pointed,
like the lance of a knight, at the power of England. Her
north star was the freedom of a nation. War had nothing
to do with her, however, though her mission was warlike:
to prove that one hundred similar vessels might sail from
various parts to the Irish coast, and land an army and its
supplies without serious interference from the enemy. The
crew was a select body of men, whose souls ever sought
the danger of hopeless missions, as others seek a holiday.
In spite of fine weather and bracing seas, the cloud of a
lonely fate hung over the ship. Arthur alone was enthusiastic.
Ledwith, feverish over slight success, because it
roused the dormant appetite for complete success, and
Honora, fed upon disappointment, feared that this expedition
would prove ashen bread as usual; but the improvement
in her father's health kept her cheerful. Doyle
Grahame, always in high spirits, devoted his leisure to
writing the book which was to bring him fame and much
money. He described its motive and aim to his companions.</p>

<p>"It calls a halt," he said "on the senseless haste of
Christians to take up such pagans as Matthew Arnold, and
raises a warning cry against surrender to the pagan spirit
which is abroad."</p>

<p>"And do you think that the critics will read it and be
overcome?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"It will convince the critics, not that they are pagans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but that I am. They will review it, therefore, just to
annoy me."</p>

<p>"You reason just like a critic, from anywhere to nowhere."</p>

<p>"The book will make a stir, nevertheless," and Doyle
showed his confidence.</p>

<p>"It's to be a loud protest, and will tangle the supple
legs of Henry Ward Beecher and other semi-pagans like
a lasso."</p>

<p>"How about the legs of the publishers?"</p>

<p>"That's their lookout. I have nothing against them,
and I hope at the close of the sale they will have nothing
against me."</p>

<p>"When, where, with what title, binding and so
forth?"</p>

<p>"Speak not overmuch to thy dentist," said Grahame
slyly. "Already he knoweth too many of thy mouth's
secrets."</p>

<p>The young men kept the little company alive with their
pranks and their badinage. Grahame discovered in the
Captain a rare personality, who had seen the globe in its
entirety, particularly the underside, as a detective and
secret service agent for various governments. He was a
tall, slender man, rather like a New England deacon than a
daring adventurer, with a refined face, a handsome beard,
and a speaking, languid gray eye. He spent the first
week in strict devotion to his duties, and in close observation
of his passengers. In the second week Grahame had
him telling stories after dinner for the sole purpose of
diverting the sad and anxious thoughts of Honora, although
Arthur hardly gave her time to think by the
multiplied services which he rendered her. There came
an afternoon of storm, followed by a nasty night, which
kept all the passengers in the cabin; and after tea there,
a demand was made upon Captain Richard Curran for the
best and longest story in his repertory. The men lit pipes
and cigars, and Honora brought her crotcheting. The
rolling and tossing of the ship, the beating of the rain,
and the roar of the wind, gave them a sense of comfort.
The ship, in her element, proudly and smoothly rode the
rough waves, showing her strength like a racer.</p>

<p>"Let us have a choice, Captain," said Grahame, as
the officer settled himself in his chair. "You detectives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
always set forth your successes. Give us now a story of
complete failure, something that remains a mystery till
now."</p>

<p>"Mystery is the word," said Honora. "This is a night
of mystery. But a story without an end to it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like the history of Ireland," said Ledwith dryly.</p>

<p>"Is the very one to keep us thinking and talking for a
month," said Grahame. "Captain, if you will oblige us,
a story of failure and of mystery."</p>

<p>"Such a one is fresh in my mind, for I fled from my
ill-success to take charge of this expedition," said the
Captain, whose voice was singularly pleasant. "The detective
grows stale sometimes, as singers and musicians
do, makes a failure of his simplest work, and has to go
off and sharpen his wits at another trade. I am in that
condition. For twenty months I sought the track of
a man, who disappeared as if the air absorbed him where
he last breathed. I did not find him. The search gave
me a touch of monomania. For two months I have not
been able to rest upon meeting a new face until satisfied
its owner was not&mdash;let us say, Tom Jones."</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, then," said Arthur, "that we are
all right?"</p>

<p>"He was not an Irishman, but a Puritan," replied the
Captain, "and would not be found in a place like this. I
admit I studied your faces an hour or so, and asked about
you among the men, but under protest. I have given up
the pursuit of Tom Jones, and I wish he would give up
the pursuit of me. I had to quiet my mind with some
inquiries."</p>

<p>"Was there any money awaiting Tom? If so, I might
be induced to be discovered," Grahame said anxiously.</p>

<p>"You are all hopeless, Mr. Grahame. I have known
you and Mr. Ledwith long enough, and Mr. Dillon has
his place secure in New York&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a weak spot in my history," said Arthur. "I
was off in California, playing bad boy for ten years."</p>

<p>The Captain waved his hand as admitting Dillon's right
to his personality.</p>

<p>"In October nearly two years ago the case of Tom
Jones was placed in my care with orders to report at once
to Mrs. Tom. The problem of finding a lost man is in
itself very simple, if he is simply lost or in hiding. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
follow his track from the place where he was last seen to
his new abode. But around this simple fact of disappearance
are often grouped the interests of many persons,
which make a tangle worse than a poor fisherman's line.
A proper detective will make no start in his search until
the line is as straight and taut as if a black bass were
sporting at the other end of it."</p>

<p>All the men exchanged delighted glances at this simile.</p>

<p>"I could spin this story for three hours straight talking
of the characters who tangled me at the start. But I did
not budge until I had unraveled them every one. Mrs.
Jones declared there was no reason for the disappearance
of Tom; his aunt Quincy said her flightiness had driven
him to it; and Cousin Jack, Mrs. Tom's adviser, thought
it just a freak after much dissipation, for Tom had been
acting queerly for months before he did the vanishing act.
The three were talking either from spleen or the wish to
hide the truth. When there was no trace of Tom after a
month of ordinary searching much of the truth came out,
and I discovered the rest. Plain speech with Mrs. Tom
brought her to the half-truth. She was told that her
husband would never be found if the detective had to work
in the dark. She was a clever woman, and very much
worried, for reasons, over her husband's disappearance.
It was something to have her declare that he had suspected
her fidelity, but chiefly out of spleen, because she had
discovered his infidelity. A little sifting of many statements,
which took a long time, for I was on the case
nearly two years, as I said, revealed Mrs. Tom as a remarkable
woman. In viciousness she must have been something
of a monster, though she was beautiful enough to
have posed for an angel. Her corruption was of the
marrow. She breathed crime and bred it. But her blade
was too keen. She wounded herself too often. Grit and
ferocity were her strong points. We meet such women
occasionally. When she learned that I knew as much
about her as need be, she threw off hypocrisy, and made
me an offer of ten thousand dollars to find her husband."</p>

<p>"I felt sure then of the money. Disappearance, for a
living man, if clever people are looking for him, is impossible
nowadays. I can admit the case of a man being
secretly killed or self-buried, say, for instance, his wandering
into a swamp and there perishing: these cases of dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>appearance
are common. But if he is alive he can be
found."</p>

<p>"Why are you so sure of that?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Because no man can escape from his past, which is
more a part of him than his heart or his liver," said
Curran. "That past is the pathway which leads to him.
If you have it, it's only a matter of time when you will
have him."</p>

<p>"Yet you failed to find Tom Jones."</p>

<p>"For the time, yes," said the Captain with an eloquent
smile. "Then, I had an antagonist of the noblest quality.
Tom Jones was a bud of the Mayflower stock. All his
set agreed that he was an exceptional man: a clean, honest,
upright chap, the son of a soldier and a peerless mother,
apparently an every-day lad, but really as fine a piece of
manhood as the world turns out. Anyhow, I came to that
conclusion about him when I had studied him through
the documents. What luck threw him between the foul
jaws of his wife I can't say. She was a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective coughed before uttering the word,
and looked at the men as he changed the form of his
sentence.</p>

<p>"She was a cruel creature. He adored her, and she
hated him, and when he was gone slandered him with a
laugh, and defiled his honest name."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Honora with a gasp of pain, "can there be
such women now? I have read of them in history, but I
always felt they were far off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope they are not many," said the Captain politely,
"but in my profession I have met them. Here was a case
where the best of men was the victim of an Agrippina."</p>

<p>"Poor, dear lad," sighed she, "and of course he fled
from her in horror."</p>

<p>"He was a wonder, Miss Ledwith. Think what he did.
Such a man is more than a match for such a woman. He
discovered her unfaithfulness months before he disappeared.
Then he sold all his property, turning all he
owned into money, and transferred it beyond any reach but
his own, leaving his wife just what she brought him&mdash;an
income from her parents of fifteen hundred a year: a mere
drop to a woman whom he had dowered with a share in
one hundred thousand. Though I could not follow the
tracks of his feet, I saw the traces of his thoughts as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
executed his scheme of vengeance. He discovered her
villainy, he would have no scandal, he was disgusted with
life, so he dropped out of it with the prize for which she
had married him, and left her like a famished wolf in the
desert. It would have satisfied him to have seen her rage
and dismay, but he was not one of the kind that enjoys
torture."</p>

<p>"I watched Mrs. Tom for months, and felt she was the
nearest thing to a demon I had ever met. Well, I worked
hard to find Tom. We tried many tricks to lure him from
his hiding-place, if it were near by, and we followed many
a false trail into foreign lands. The result was dreadful
to me. We found nothing. When a child was born to
him, and the fact advertised, and still he did not appear,
or give the faintest sign, I surrendered. It would be
tedious to describe for you how I followed the sales of his
property, how I examined his last traces, how I pursued
all clues, how I wore myself out with study. At the last
I gave out altogether and cut the whole business. I was
beginning to have Tom on the brain. He came to live on
my nerves, and to haunt my dreams, and to raise ghosts
for me. He is gone two years, and Mrs. Tom is in
Europe with her baby and Tom's aunt Quincy. When I
get over my present trouble, and get back a clear brain,
I shall take up the search. I shall find him yet. I'd like
to show some of the documents, but the matter is still
confidential, and I must keep quiet, though I don't suppose
you know any of the parties. When I find him I shall
finish the story for you."</p>

<p>"You will never find him," said Honora with emphasis.
"That fearful woman shattered his very soul. I know
the sort of a man he was. He will never go back. If he
can bear to live, it will be because in his obscurity God
gave him new faith and hope in human nature, and in the
woman's part of it."</p>

<p>"I shall find him," said the detective.</p>

<p>"You won't," said Grahame. "I'll wager he has been
so close to you all this time, that you cannot recognize
him. That man is living within your horizon, if he's living
at all. Probably he has aided you in your search. You
wouldn't be the first detective fooled in that game."</p>

<p>The Captain made no reply, but went off to see how his
ship was bearing the storm. The little company fell silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
perhaps depressed by the sounds of tempest without and
the thought of the poor soul whose departure from life had
been so strange. Arthur sat thinking of many things.
He remembered the teaching that to God the past, present,
and future are as one living present. Here was an illustration:
the old past and the new present side by side to-night
in the person of this detective. What a giant hand
was that which could touch him, and fail to seize only
because the fingers did not know their natural prey. No
doubt that the past is more a part of a man than his heart,
for here was every nerve of his body tingling to turn
traitor to his will. Horace Endicott, so long stilled that
he thought him dead, rose from his sleep at the bidding of
the detective, and fought to betray Arthur Dillon. The
blush, the trembling of the hands, the tension of the
muscles, the misty eye, the pallor of the cheek, the tremulous
lip, the writhing tongue, seemed to put themselves
at the service of Endicott, and to fight for the chance to
betray the secret to Curran. He sat motionless, fighting,
fighting; until after a little he felt a delightful consciousness
of the strength of Dillon, as of a rampart which the
Endicott could not overclimb. Then his spirits rose, and he
listened without dread to the story. How pitiful! What a
fate for that splendid boy, the son of a brave soldier and a
peerless mother! A human being allied with a beast!
Oh, tender heart of Honora that sighed for him so pitifully!
Oh, true spirit that recognized how impossible for
Horace Endicott ever to return! Down, out of sight forever,
husband of Agrippina! The furies lie in wait for
thee, wretched husband of their daughter! Have shame
enough to keep in thy grave until thou goest to meet
Sonia at the judgment seat!</p>

<p>Captain Curran was not at all flattered by the deep interest
which Arthur took for the next two days in the case
of Tom Jones; but the young man nettled him by his
emphatic assertions that the detective had adopted a wrong
theory as to the mysterious disappearance. They went
over the question of motives and of methods. The shrewd
objections of Dillon gave him favor in Curran's eyes.
Before long the secret documents in the Captain's possession
were laid before him under obligations of secrecy.
He saw various photographs of Endicott, and wondered at
the blindness of man; for here side by side were the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sought and his portrait, yet the detective could not see the
truth. Was it possible that the exterior man had changed
so thoroughly to match the inner personality which had
grown up in him? He was conscious of such a change.
The mirror which reflected Arthur Dillon displayed a
figure in no way related to the portrait.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Arthur, after a study of the
photograph, "that I would be able to reach that man, no
matter what his disguise."</p>

<p>"Disguises are mere veils," said Curran, "which the
trained eye of the detective can pierce easily. But the
great difficulty lies in a natural disguise, in the case where
the man's appearance changes without artificial aids. Here
are two photographs which will illustrate my meaning.
Look at this."</p>

<p>Arthur saw a young and well-dressed fellow who might
have been a student of good birth and training.</p>

<p>"Now look at this," said the Captain, "and discover
that they picture one and the same individual, with a
difference in age of two years."</p>

<p>The second portrait was a vigorous, rudely-dressed,
bearded adventurer, as much like the first as Dillon was
like Grahame. Knowing that the portraits stood for the
same youth, Arthur could trace a resemblance in the
separate features, but in the ensemble there was no likeness.</p>

<p>"The young fellow went from college to Africa," said
Curran, "where he explored the wilderness for two years.
This photograph was taken on his return from an expedition.
His father and mother, his relatives and friends,
saw that picture without recognizing him. When told
who it was, they were wholly astonished, and after a second
study still failed to recognize their friend. What are you
going to do in a case of that kind? You or Grahame or Ledwith
might be Tom Jones, and how could I pierce such
perfect and natural disguises."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Arthur, as he stood with Endicott's
photograph in his hand and studied the detective, "if I
can see this young man in you."</p>

<p>Having compared the features of the portrait and of the
detective, he had to admit the absence of a likeness.
Handing the photograph to the Captain he said,</p>

<p>"You do the same for me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is more likelihood in your case," said Curran,
"for your age is nearer that of Tom Jones, and youth has
resemblances of color and feature."</p>

<p>He studied the photograph and compared it with the
grave face before him.</p>

<p>"I have done this before," said Curran, "with the same
result. You are ten years older than Tom Jones, and you
are as clearly Arthur Dillon as he was Tom Jones."</p>

<p>The young man and the Captain sighed together.</p>

<p>"Oh, I brought in others, clever and experienced,"
said Curran, "to try what a fresh mind could do to help
me, but in vain."</p>

<p>"There must have been something hard about Tom
Jones," said Arthur, "when he was able to stay away and
make no sign after his child was born."</p>

<p>The Captain burst into a mocking laugh, which escaped
him before he could repress the inclination.</p>

<p>"He may never have heard of it, and if he did his wife's
reputation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," said Arthur Dillon smiling, convinced that
Captain Curran knew more of Sonia Westfield than he
cared to tell. At the detective's request the matter was
dropped as one that did him harm; but he complimented
Arthur on the shrewdness of his suggestions, which indeed
had given him new views without changing his former
opinions.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE INVASION OF IRELAND.</h3>


<p>One lovely morning the good ship sailed into the harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of Foreskillen, an obscure fishing port on the lonely coast
of Donegal. The <i>Arrow</i> had been in sight of land all the
day before. A hush had fallen on the spirits of the adventurers.
The two innocents, Honora and her father,
had sat on deck with eyes fixed on the land of their love,
scarcely able to speak, and unwilling to eat, in spite of
Arthur's coaxing. Half the night they sat there, mostly
silent, talking reverently, every one touched and afraid
to disturb them; after a short sleep they were on deck
again to see the ship enter the harbor in the gray dawn.
The sun was still behind the brown hills. Arthur saw a
silver bay, a mournful shore with a few houses huddled
miserably in the distance, and bare hills without verdure
or life. It was an indifferent part of the earth to him;
but revealed in the hearts of Owen Ledwith and his
daughter, no jewel of the mines could have shone more
resplendent. He did not understand the love called patriotism,
any more than the love of a parent for his child.
These affections have to be experienced to be known. He
loved his country and was ready to die for it; but to have
bled for it, to have writhed under tortures for it, to have
groaned in unison with its mortal anguish, to have passed
through the fire of death and yet lived for it, these were not
his glories.</p>

<p>In the cool, sad morning the father and daughter stood
glorified in his eyes, for if they loved each other much,
they loved this strange land more. The white lady, whiter
now than lilies, stood with her arm about her father, her
eyes shining; and he, poor man, trembled in an ague of
love and pity and despair and triumph, with a rapt, grief-stricken
face, his shoulders heaving to the repressed sob,
as if nature would there make an end of him under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
torrent of delight and pain. Arthur writhed in secret
humiliation. To love like this was of the gods, and he
had never loved anything so but Agrippina. As the ship
glided to her anchorage the crew stood about the deck in
absolute silence, every man's heart in his face, the watch
at its post, the others leaning on the bulwarks. Like
statues they gazed on the shore. It seemed a phantom
ship, blown from ghostly shores by the strength of hatred
against the enemy, and love for the land of Eire; for no
hope shone in their eyes, or in the eyes of Ledwith and
his daughter, only triumph at their own light success.
What a pity, thought Dillon, that at this hour of time
men should have reason to look so at the power of England.
He knew there were millions of them scattered over the
earth, studying in just hate to shake the English grip on
stolen lands, to pay back the robberies of years in English
blood.</p>

<p>The ship came to anchor amid profound silence, save for
the orders of the Captain and the movements of the men.
Ledwith was speaking to himself more than to Honora,
a lament in the Irish fashion over the loved and lost, in a
way to break the heart. The tears rolled down Honora's
cheek, for the agony was beginning.</p>

<p>"Land of love ... land of despair ... without a friend
except among thy own children ... here am I back again
with just a grain of hope ... I love thee, I love thee, I
love thee! Let them neglect thee ... die every moment
under the knife ... live in rags ... in scorn ... and
hatred too ... they have spared thee nothing ... I love
thee ... I am faithful ... God strike me that day when
I forget thee! Here is the first gift I have ever given thee
besides my heart and my daughter ... a ship ... no
freight but hope ... no guns alas! for thy torturers ...
they are still free to tear thee, these wolves, and to lie about
thee to the whole world ... blood and lies are their feast
... and how sweet are thy shores ... after all ... because
thou art everlasting! Thy children are gone, but they
shall come back ... the dead are dead, but the living
are in many lands, and they will return ... perhaps soon
... I am the messenger ... helpless as ever, but I bring
thee news ... good news ... my beautiful Ireland!
Poorer than ever I return ... I shall never see thee
free&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>He was working himself into a fever of grief when
Honora spoke to him.</p>

<p>"You are forgetting, father, that this is the moment to
thank Mr. Dillon in the name of our country&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I forget everything when I am here," said Ledwith,
breaking into cheerful smiles, and seizing Arthur's hand.
"I would be ashamed to say 'thank you,' Arthur, for
what you have done. Let this dear land herself welcome
you to her shores. Never a foot stepped on them worthier
of respect and love than you."</p>

<p>They went ashore in silence, having determined on
their course the night previous. They must learn first what
had happened since their departure from New York, where
there had been rumors of a rising, which Ledwith distrusted.
It was too soon for the Fenians to rise; but as
the movement had gotten partly beyond the control of the
leaders, anything might have happened. If the country was
still undisturbed, they might enjoy a ride through wild
Donegal; if otherwise, it was safer, having accomplished the
purpose of the trip, to sail back to the West. The miserable
village at the head of the bay showed a few dwellers
when they landed on the beach, but little could be learned
from them, save directions to a distant cotter who owned
an ass and a cart, and always kept information and mountain
dew for travelers and the gentry. The young men
visited the cotter, and returned with the cart and the news.
The rising was said to have begun, but farther east and
south, and the cotter had seen soldiers and police and squads
of men hurrying over the country; but so remote was the
storm that the whole party agreed a ride over the bare
hills threatened no danger.</p>

<p>They mounted the cart in high spirits, now that emotion
had subsided. All matters had been arranged with Captain
Curran, who was not to expect them earlier than the
next day at evening, and had his instructions for all contingencies.
They set out for a village to the north,
expressly to avoid encounters possible southward. The
morning was glorious. Arthur wondered at the miles of
uninhabited land stretching away on either side of the road,
at the lack of population in a territory so small. He had
heard of these things before, but the sight of them
proved stranger than the hearing. Perhaps they had gone
five miles on the road to Cruarig, when Grahame, driv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>ing,
pulled up the donkey with suddenness, and cried out
in horror. Eight men had suddenly come in sight on
the road, armed with muskets, and as suddenly fled up the
nearest timbered hill and disappeared.</p>

<p>"I'll wager something," said Grahame, "that these men
are being pursued by the police, or&mdash;which would be worse
for us&mdash;by soldiers. There is nothing to do but retreat
in good order, and send out a scout to make sure of the
ground. We ought to have done that the very first thing."</p>

<p>No one gainsaid him, but Arthur thought that they
might go on a bit further cautiously, and if nothing
suspicious occurred reach the town. Dubiously Grahame
whipped up the donkey, and drove with eyes alert past the
wooded hill, which on its north side dropped into a little
glen watered by the sweetest singing brook. They paused
to look at the brook and the glen. The road stretched
away above and below like a ribbon. A body of soldiers
suddenly brightened the north end of the ribbon two
miles off.</p>

<p>"Now by all the evil gods," said Grahame, "but we
have dropped into the very midst of the insurrection."</p>

<p>He was about to turn the donkey, when Honora cried
out in alarm and pointed back over the road which they
had just traveled. Another scarlet troop was moving
upon them from that direction. Without a word Grahame
turned the cart into the glen, and drove as far as the limits
would permit within the shade. They alighted.</p>

<p>"This is our only chance," he said. "The eight men
with muskets are rebels whom the troops have cornered.
There may be a large force in the vicinity, ready to give the
soldiers of Her Majesty a stiff battle. The soldiers will be
looking for rebels and not for harmless tourists, and we may
escape comfortably by keeping quiet until the two divisions
marching towards each other have met and had an
explanation. If we are discovered, I shall do the talking,
and explain our embarrassment at meeting so many armed
men first, and then so many soldiers. We are in for it, I
know."</p>

<p>No one seemed to mind particularly. Honora stole an
anxious glance at her father, while she pulled a little
bunch of shamrock and handed it to Arthur. He felt
like saying it would yet be stained by his blood in defense
of her country, but knew at the same moment how foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and weak the words would sound in her ears. He offered
himself as a scout to examine the top of the hill, and discover
if the rebels were there, and was permitted to go
under cautions from Grahame, to return within fifteen minutes.
He returned promptly full of enthusiasm. The eight
men were holding the top of the hill, almost over their heads,
and would have it out with the two hundred soldiers from
the town. They had expected a body of one hundred insurgents
at this point, but the party had not turned up. Eager
to have a brush with the enemy, they intended to hold
the hill as long as possible, and then scatter in different
directions, sure that pursuit could not catch them.</p>

<p>"The thing for them to do is to save us," said Grahame.
"Let them move on to another hill northward, and while
they fight the soldiers we may be able to slip back to the
ship."</p>

<p>The suggestion came too late. The troops were in
full sight. Their scouts had met in front of the glen,
evidently acting upon information received earlier, and
seemed disappointed at finding no trace of a body of
insurgents large enough to match their own battalion. The
boys on the top of the hill put an end to speculations as
to the next move by firing a volley into them. A great
scattering followed, and the bid for a fight was cheerfully
answered by the officer in command of the troops. Having
joined his companies, examined the position and made
sure that its defenders were few and badly armed, he
ordered a charge. In five minutes the troops were in
possession of the hilltop, and the insurgents had fled; but
on the hillside lay a score of men wounded and dead.
The rebels were good marksmen, and fleet-footed. The
scouts beat the bushes and scoured the wood in vain.
The report to the commanding officer was the wounding of
two men, who were just then dying in a little glen close by,
and the discovery of a party of tourists in the glen, who had
evidently turned aside to escape the trouble, and were now
ministering to the dying rebels.</p>

<p>Captain Sydenham went up to investigate. Before he
arrived the little drama of death had passed, and the two
insurgents lay side by side at the margin of the brook
like brothers asleep. When the insurgents fled from
their position, the two wounded ones dropped into the
glen in the hope of escaping notice for the time; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
were far spent when they fell headlong among the party in
hiding below. Grahame and Ledwith picked them up
and laid them near the brook, Honora pillowed their
heads with coats, Arthur brought water to bathe their
hands and faces, grimy with dust of travel and sweat of
death; for an examination of the wounds showed Ledwith
that they were speedily mortal. He dipped his handkerchief
in the flowing blood of each, and placed it reverently
in his breast. There was nothing to do but bathe the
faces and moisten the lips of the dying and unconscious
men. They were young, one rugged and hard, the other
delicate in shape and color; the same grace of youth belonged
to both, and showed all the more beautifully at
this moment through the heavy veil of death.</p>

<p>Arthur gazed at them with eager curiosity, and at the
red blood bubbling from their wounds. For their country
they were dying, as his father had died, on the field of
battle. This blood, of which he had so often read, was the
price which man pays for liberty, which redeems the
slave; richer than molten gold, than sun and stars, priceless.
Oh, sweet and glorious, unutterably sweet to die like
this for men!</p>

<p>"Do you recognize him?" said Ledwith to Grahame,
pointing to the elder of the two. Grahame bent forward,
startled that he should know either unfortunate.</p>

<p>"It is young Devin, the poet," cried Ledwith with a
burst of tears. Honora moaned, and Grahame threw up
his hands in despair.</p>

<p>"We must give the best to our mother," said Ledwith,
"but I would prefer blood so rich to be scattered over a
larger soil."</p>

<p>He took the poet's hand in his own, and stroked it
gently; Honora wiped the face of the other; Grahame on
his knees said the prayers he remembered for sinners and
passing souls; secretly Arthur put in his pocket a
rag stained with death-sweat and life-blood. Almost in
silence, without painful struggle, the boys died. Devin
opened his eyes one moment on the clear blue sky and
made an effort to sing. He chanted a single phrase, which
summed up his life and its ideals: "Mother, always the
best for Ireland." Then his eyes closed and his heart
stopped. The little party remained silent, until Honora,
looking at the still faces, so young and tender, thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the mothers sitting in her place, and began to weep aloud.
At this moment Captain Sydenham marched up the
glen with clinking spur. He stopped at a distance and
took off his hat with the courtesy of a gentleman and the
sympathy of a soldier. Grahame went forward to meet
him, and made his explanations.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly clear," said the Captain, "that you are
tourists and free from all suspicion. However, it will be
necessary for you to accompany me to the town and make
your declarations to the magistrate as well. As you were
going there anyhow it will be no hardship, and I shall be
glad to make matters as pleasant as possible for the young
lady."</p>

<p>Grahame thanked him, and introduced him to the party.
He bowed very low over the hand which Honora gave him.</p>

<p>"A rather unfortunate scene for you to witness," he said.</p>

<p>Yet she had borne it like one accustomed to scenes of
horror. Her training in Ledwith's school bred calmness,
and above all silence, amid anxiety, disappointment and
calamity.</p>

<p>"I was glad to be here," she replied, the tears still
coursing down her face, "to take their mother's place."</p>

<p>"Two beautiful boys," said the Captain, looking into
the dead faces. "Killing men is a bad business anywhere,
but when we have to kill our own, and such as
these, it is so much worse."</p>

<p>Ledwith flashed the officer a look of gratitude.</p>

<p>"I shall have the bodies carried to the town along with
our own dead, and let the authorities take care of them.
And now if you will have the goodness to take your places,
I shall do myself the pleasure of riding with you as far as
the magistrate's."</p>

<p>Honora knelt and kissed the pale cheeks of the dead
boys, and then accepted Captain Sydenham's arm in the
march out of the glen. The men followed sadly. Ledwith
looked wild for a while. The tears pressed against
Arthur's eyes. What honor gilded these dead heroes!</p>

<p>The procession moved along the road splendidly, the
soldiers in front and the cart in the rear, while a detail
still farther off carried the wounded and dead. Captain
Sydenham devoted himself to Honora, which gave Grahame
the chance to talk matters over with Ledwith on the other
side of the car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever dream in all your rainbow dreams," said
Grahame, "of marching thus into Cruarig with escort of
Her Majesty? It's damfunny. But the question now is,
what are we to do with the magistrate? Any sort of an
inquiry will prove that we are more than suspicious characters.
If they run across the ship we shall go to jail. If
they discover you and me, death or Botany Bay will be
our destination."</p>

<p>"It is simply a case of luck," Ledwith replied.
"Scheming won't save us. If Lord Constantine were in
London now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried Grahame in a whisper, "there's
the luck. Say no more. I'll work that fine name as it
was never worked before."</p>

<p>He called out to Captain Sydenham to come around to
his side of the car for a moment.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he said, "that we have fallen upon evil
conditions, and that, before we get through with the
magistrates, delays will be many and vexatious. I feel
that we shall need some of our English friends of last
winter in New York. Do you know Lord Constantine?"</p>

<p>"Are you friends of Lord Leverett?" cried the Captain.
"Well, then, that settles it. A telegram from him will
smooth the magistrate to the silkiness of oil. But I do
not apprehend any annoyance. I shall be happy to explain
the circumstances, and you can get away to Dublin,
or any port where you hope to meet your ship."</p>

<p>The Captain went back to Honora, and talked Lord
Constantine until they arrived in the town and proceeded
to the home of the magistrate. Unfortunately there was
little cordiality between Captain Sydenham and Folsom,
the civil ruler of the district; and because the gallant
Captain made little of the episode therefore Folsom must
make much of it.</p>

<p>"I can easily believe in the circumstances which threw
tourists into so unpleasant a situation," said Folsom, "but
at the same time I am compelled to observe all the formalities.
Of course the young lady is free. Messrs. Dillon
and Grahame may settle themselves comfortably in the
town, on their word not to depart without permission.
Mr. Ledwith has a name which my memory connects with
treasonable doings and sayings. He must remain for a
few hours at least in the jail."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is not at all pleasant," said Captain Sydenham
pugnaciously. "I could have let these friends of my
friends go without troubling you about them. I wished
to make it easier for them to travel to Dublin by bringing
them before you, and here is my reward."</p>

<p>"I wish you had, Captain," said the magistrate. "But
now you've done it, neither is free to do more than follow
the routine. We have enough real work without annoying
honest travelers. However, it's only a matter of a
few hours."</p>

<p>"Then you had better telegraph to Lord Constantine,"
said Sydenham to Grahame.</p>

<p>Folsom started at the name and looked at the party with
a puzzled frown. Grahame wrote on a sheet of paper the
legend: "A telegram from you to the authorities here
will get Honora and her party out of much trouble."</p>

<p>"Is it as warm as that?" said the Captain with a smile,
as he read the lines and handed the paper to Folsom with
a broad grin.</p>

<p>"I'm in for it now," groaned Folsom to himself as he
read. "Wish I'd let the Captain alone and tended to
strict business."</p>

<p>While the wires were humming between Dublin and
Cruarig, Captain Sydenham spent his spare time in atoning
for his blunders against the comfort of the party. Ledwith
having been put in jail most honorably, the Captain
led the others to the inn and located them sumptuously.
He arranged for lunch, at which he was to join them, and
then left them to their ease while he transacted his own
affairs.</p>

<p>"One of the men you read about," said Grahame, as
the three looked at one another dolorously. "Sorry I
didn't confide in him from the start. Now it's a dead
certainty that your father stays in jail, Honora, and I may
be with him."</p>

<p>"I really can't see any reason for such despair," said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied Grahame. "But even Lord
Constantine could not save Owen Ledwith from prison in
times like these, if the authorities learn his identity."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" inquired Honora.</p>

<p>"You will stay with your father of course?" Honora
nodded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to make a run for it at the first opportunity,"
said Grahame. "I can be of no use here, and
we must get back the ship safe and sound. Arthur, if
they hold Ledwith you will have the honor of working for
his freedom. Owen is an American citizen. He ought
to have all the rights and privileges of a British subject
in his trial, if it comes to that. He won't get them unless
the American minister to the court of St. James insists
upon it. Said minister, being a doughhead, will not insist.
He will even help to punish him. It will be your
business to go up to London and make Livingstone do his
duty if you have to choke him black in the face. If the
American minister interferes in this case Lord Constantine
will be a power. If the said minister hangs back, or
says, hang the idiot, my Lord will not amount to a hill of
beans."</p>

<p>"If it comes to a trial," said Arthur, "won't Ledwith
get the same chance as any other lawbreaker?"</p>

<p>Honora and Grahame looked at each other as much as
to say: "Poor innocent!"</p>

<p>"When there's a rising on, my dear boy, there is no
trial for Irishmen. Arrest means condemnation, and all
that follows is only form. Go ahead now and do your
best."</p>

<p>Before lunch the telegrams had done their best and
worst. The party was free to go as they came with the
exception of Ledwith. They had a merry lunch, enlivened
by a telegram from Lord Constantine, and by
Folsom's discomfiture. Then Grahame drove away to the
ship, Arthur set out for Dublin, and Honora was left
alone with her dread and her sorrows, which Captain
Sydenham swore would be the shortest of her life.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">CASTLE MOYNA.</h3>


<p>The Dillon party took possession of Castle Moyna, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
mistress, and Captain Sydenham, who had a fondness for
Americans. Mona Everard owned any human being who
looked at her the second time, as the oriole catches the
eye with its color and then the heart with its song; and
Louis had the same magnetism in a lesser degree. Life
at the castle was not of the liveliest, but with the Captain's
aid it became as rapid as the neighboring gentry could
have desired. Anne cared little, so that her children had
their triumph. Wrapped in her dreams of amethyst, the
exquisiteness of this new world kept her in ecstasy. Its
smallest details seemed priceless. She performed each
function as if it were the last of her life. While rebuffs
were not lacking, she parried them easily, and even the
refusal of the parish priest to accept her aid in his bazaar
did not diminish the delight of her happy situation. She
knew the meaning of his refusal: she, an upstart, having
got within the gates of Castle Moyna by some servility,
when her proper place was a <i>shebeen</i> in Cruarig, offered
him charity from a low motive. She felt a rebuke from a
priest as a courtier a blow from his king; but keeping her
temper, she made many excuses for him in her own mind,
without losing the firm will to teach him better manners
in her own reverent way. The Countess heard of it, and
made a sharp complaint to Captain Sydenham. The old
dowager had a short temper, and a deep gratitude for
Anne's remarkable services in New York. Nor did she care
to see her guests slighted.</p>

<p>"Father Roslyn has treated her shabbily. She suggested
a booth at his bazaar, offered to fit it up herself and to
bring the gentry to buy. She was snubbed: 'neither your
money nor your company.' You must set that right,
Sydenham," said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"He shall weep tears of brine for it," answered the
Captain cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said the Dowager, "the whole story, if your
priest can appreciate it, which I doubt. A Cavan peasant,
who can teach the fine ladies of Dublin how to dress and
how to behave; whose people are half the brains of New
York; the prize-fighter turned senator, the Boss of Tammany,
the son with a gold mine. Above all, don't forget
to tell how she may name the next ambassador to England."</p>

<p>They laughed in sheer delight at her accomplishments
and her triumphs.</p>

<p>"Gad, but she's the finest woman," the Captain declared.
"At first I thought it was acting, deuced fine
acting. But it's only her nature finding expression.
What d'ye think she's planning now? An audience with
the Pope, begad, special, to present an American flag and
a thousand pounds. And she laid out Lady Cruikshank
yesterday, stone cold. Said her ladyship: 'Quite a compliment
to Ireland, Mrs. Dillon, that you kept the Cavan
brogue so well.' Said Mrs. Dillon: 'It was all I ever got
from Ireland, and a brogue in New York is always a recommendation
to mercy from the court; then abroad it
marks one off from the common English and their common
Irish imitators.' Did she know of Lady Cruikshank's
effort to file off the Dublin brogue?"</p>

<p>"Likely. She seems to know the right thing at the
right minute."</p>

<p>Evidently Anne's footing among the nobility was fairly
secure in spite of difficulties. There were difficulties below
stairs also, and Judy Haskell had the task of solving them,
which she did with a success quite equal to Anne's. She
made no delay in seizing the position of arbiter in the
servants' hall, not only of questions touching the Dillons,
and their present relations with the Irish nobility, but
also on such vital topics as the rising, the Fenians, the
comparative rank of the Irish at home and those in
America, and the standing of the domestics in Castle
Moyna from the point of experience and travel. Inwardly
Judy had a profound respect for domestics in the service
of a countess, and looked to find them as far above herself
as a countess is above the rest of the world. She would
have behaved humbly among the servants of Castle Moyna,
had not their airs betrayed them for an inferior grade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"These Americans," said the butler with his nose in the
air.</p>

<p>"As if ye knew anythin' about Americans," said Judy
promptly. "Have ye ever thraveled beyant Donegal, me
good little man?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't necessary, me good woman."</p>

<p>"Faith, it's yerself 'ud be blowin' about it if ye had.
An' d'ye think people that thraveled five thousan' miles
to spind a few dollars on yer miserable country wud luk at
the likes o' ye? Keep yer criticisms on these Americans in
yer own buzzum. It's not becomin' that an ould gossoon
shud make remarks on Mrs. Dillon, the finest lady in New
York, an' the best dhressed at this minnit in all Ireland.
Whin ye've thraveled as much as I have ye can have me
permission to talk on what ye have seen."</p>

<p>"The impidence o' some people," said the cook with a
loud and scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"If ye laughed that way in New York," said Judy,
"ye'd be sint to the Island for breaking the public peace.
A laugh like that manes no increase o' wages."</p>

<p>"The Irish in New York are allowed to live there I belave,"
said a pert housemaid with a simper.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, an' they are also allowed to sind home
the rint o' their houses to kape the poor Irish from starvin',
an' to help the lords an' ladies of yer fine castles to kape
the likes o' yees in a job."</p>

<p>"'Twas always a wondher to me," said the cook to the
housemaid, as if no other was present, "how these American
bigbugs wid their inilligant ways ever got as far as the
front door o' the Countess."</p>

<p>"I can tell ye how Mrs. Dillon got in so far that her fut
is on the neck of all o' yez this minnit," said Judy. "If
she crooked her finger at ye this hour, ye'd take yer pack on
yer back an' fut it over to yer father's shanty, wid no more
chance for another place than if ye wor in Timbuctoo.
The Countess o' Skibbereen kem over to New York to
hould a concert, an' to raise money for the cooks an'
housemaids an' butlers that were out of places in Donegal.
Well, she cudn't get a singer, nor she couldn't get a hall,
nor she cudn't sell a ticket, till Mrs. Dillon gathered around
her the Boss of Tammany Hall, an' Senator Dillon, an'
Mayor Birmingham, an' Mayor Livingstone, an' says to
thim, 'let the Countess o' Skibbereen have a concert an' let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Tammany Hall buy every ticket she has for sale, an' do
yeez turn out the town to make the concert a success.'
An' thin she got the greatest singer in the world, Honora
Ledwith, that ye cudn't buy to sing in Ireland for all the
little money there's in it, to do the singin', an' so the
Countess med enough money to buy shirts for the whole of
Ireland. But not a door wud have opened to her if Mrs.
Dillon hadn't opened them all be wan word. That's why
Castle Moyna is open to her to the back door. For me I
wondher she shtays in the poor little place, whin the
palace o' the American ambassador in London expects her."</p>

<p>The audience, awed at Judy's assurance, was urged by
pride to laugh haughtily at this last statement.</p>

<p>"An' why wudn't his palace be open to her," Judy
continued with equal scorn. "He's afraid of her. She
kem widin an ace o' spoilin' his chances o' goin' to London
an' bowin' to the Queen. An, bedad, he's not sure of his
futtin' while she's in it, for she has her mind on the place
for Mr. Vandervelt, the finest man in New York wid a
family that goes back to the first Dutchman that ever
was, a little fellow that sat fishin' in the say the day St.
Pathrick sailed for Ireland. Now Mr. Livingstone sez to
Mrs. Dillon whin he was leavin' for London, 'Come over,'
sez he, 'an' shtay at me palace as long as I'm in it.' She's
goin' there whin she laves here, but I don't see why she
shtays in this miserable place, whin she cud be among her
aquils, runnin' in an out to visit the Queen like wan o'
thimselves."</p>

<p>By degrees, as Judy's influence invaded the audience,
alarm spread among them for their own interests. They
had not been over polite to the Americans, since it was
not their habit to treat any but the nobility with more
than surface respect. New York most of them hoped to
visit and dwell within some day. What if they had
offended the most influential of the great ladies of the
western city! Judy saw their fear and guessed its
motive.</p>

<p>"Me last word to the whole o' yez is, get down an yer
knees to Mrs. Dillon afore she l'aves, if she'll let yez. I
hear that some o' ye think of immigratin' to New York.
Are yez fit for that great city? What are yer wages here?
Mebbe a pound a month. In our city the girls get four
pounds for doin' next to nothin'. An' to see the dhress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
an' the shtyle o' thim fine girls! Why, yez cudn't tell
them from their own misthresses. What wud yez be doin'
in New York, wid yer clothes thrun on yez be a pitchfork,
an' lukkin' as if they were made in the ark? But if ye
wor as smart as the lady that waits on the Queen, not wan
fut will ye set in New York if Mrs. Dillon says no. Yez
may go to Hartford or Newark, or some other little place,
an' yez'll be mighty lucky if ye're not sint sthraight on to
quarantine wid the smallpox patients an' the Turks."</p>

<p>The cook gave a gasp, and Judy saw that she had won
the day. One more struggle, however, remained before her
triumph was complete. The housekeeper and the butler
formed an alliance against her, and refused to be awed by
the stories of Mrs. Dillon's power and greatness; but as
became their station their opposition was not expressed in
mere language. They did not condescend to bandy words
with inferiors. The butler fought his battle with Judy
by simply tilting his nose toward the sky on meeting her.
Judy thereupon tilted her nose in the same fashion, so
that the servants' hall was convulsed at the sight, and the
butler had to surrender or lose his dignity. The housekeeper
carried on the battle by an attempt to stare Judy
out of countenance with a formidable eye; and the greatest
staring-match on the part of rival servants in Castle
Moyna took place between the representative of the Skibbereens
and the maid of New York. The former may
have thought her eye as good as that of the basilisk, but
found the eye of Miss Haskell much harder.</p>

<p>The housekeeper one day met Judy descending the back
stairs. She fixed her eyes upon her with the clear design of
transfixing and paralyzing this brazen American. Judy
folded her arms and turned her glance upon her foe. The
nearest onlookers held their breaths. Overcome by the
calm majesty of Judy's iron glance, which pressed against
her face like a spear, the housekeeper smiled scornfully and
began to ascend the stairs with scornful air. Judy stood
on the last step and turned her neck round and her eyes
upward until she resembled the Gorgon. She had the advantage
of the housekeeper, who in mounting the stairs had
to watch her steps; but in any event the latter was foredoomed
to defeat. The eyes that had not blinked before
Anne Dillon, or the Senator, or Mayor Livingstone, or
John Everard, or the Countess of Skibbereen, or the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Sullivan, and had modestly held their own under the
charming glance of the Monsignor, were not to be dazzled
by the fiercest glance of a mere Donegal housekeeper.
The contempt in Judy's eyes proved too much for the poor
creature, and at the top of the stairs, with a hysterical
shriek, she burst into tears and fled humbled.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd do it," said Jerry the third butler.
"It's not in thim wake craythurs to take the luk from
you, Miss Haskell."</p>

<p>"Ye're the wan dacint boy in the place," said Judy,
remembering many attentions from the shrewd lad. "An'
as soon as iver ye come to New York, an' shtay long
enough to become an American, I'll get ye a place on the
polls."</p>

<p>From that day the position of the Dillon party became
something celestial as far as the servants were concerned,
while Judy, as arbiter in the servants' hall, settled all
questions of history, science, politics, dress, and gossip, by
judgments from which there was no present appeal. All
these details floated to the ears of Captain Sydenham, who
was a favorite with Judy and shared her confidence; and
the Captain saw to it that the gossip of Castle Moyna also
floated into the parish residence daily. Some of it was so
alarming that Father Roslyn questioned his friend Captain
Sydenham, who dropped in for a quiet smoke now and
then.</p>

<p>"Who are these people, these Americans, do you know,
Captain? I mean those just now stopping with the
Countess of Skibbereen?"</p>

<p>"That reminds me," replied the Captain. "Didn't
you tell me Father William was going to America this
winter on a collecting tour? Well, if you get him the
interest of Mrs. Dillon his tour is assured of success before
he begins it."</p>

<p>A horrible fear smote the heart of the priest, nor did he
see the peculiar smile on the Captain's face. Had he
made the dreadful mistake of losing a grand opportunity
for his brother, soon to undertake a laborious mission?</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"You would have to be in New York to understand it,"
replied the Captain. "But the Countess of Skibbereen
is not a patch in this county compared to what Mrs. Dillon
is in New York!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! Do you tell me!"</p>

<p>"Her people are all in politics, and in the church, and
in business. Her son is a&mdash;well, he owns a gold mine,
I think, and he is in politics, too. In fact, it seems pretty
clear that if you want anything in New York Mrs.
Dillon is the woman to get it, as the Countess found
it. And if you are not wanted in New York by Mrs.
Dillon, then you must go west as far as Chicago."</p>

<p>"Oh, how unfortunate! I am afraid, Captain, that I
have made a blunder. Mrs. Dillon came to me&mdash;most
kindly of course&mdash;and made an offer to take care of a booth
at the bazaar, and I refused her. You know my feeling
against giving these Americans any foothold amongst
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell that to Father William, or he will never
forgive you," said the Captain. "But Mrs. Dillon is forgiving
as well as generous. Do the handsome thing by
her. Go up to the castle and explain matters, and she
will forget your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, call it foolishness at once," said the priest.
"I'm afraid I'm too late, but for the sake of charity I'll
do what you say."</p>

<p>A velvety welcome Anne gave him. Before all others
she loved the priest, and but that she had to teach Father
Roslyn a lesson he would have seen her falling at his feet
for his blessing. In some fashion he made explanation
and apology.</p>

<p>"Father dear, don't mention it. Really, it is my place
to make explanations and not yours. I was hurt, of course,
that you refused the little I can give you, but I knew other
places would be the richer by it, and charity is good everywhere."</p>

<p>"A very just thought, madam. It would give us all
great pleasure if you could renew your suggestion to take
a booth at the bazaar. We are all very fond of Americans
here&mdash;that is, when we understand them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only that I'm going up to London, father dear, I'd
be only too happy. It was not the booth I was thinking
of, you see, but the bringing of all the nobility to spend a
few pounds with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, you could never have done it," cried
he in astonishment; "they are all Protestants, and very
dark."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"We do it in America, and why not here? I used to
get more money from Protestant friends than from me
own. When I told them of my scheme here they all
promised to come for the enjoyment of it. Now, I'm so
sorry I have to go to London. I must present my letters
to the ambassador before he leaves town, and then we are
in a hurry to get to Rome before the end of August.
Cardinal Simeoni has promised us already a private audience
with the Pope. Now, father dear, if there is anything
I can do for you in Rome&mdash;of course the booth must
go up at the bazaar just the same, only the nobility will
not be there&mdash;but at Rome, now, if you wanted anything."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Dillon you overwhelm me. There
is nothing I want for myself, but my brother, Father
William&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure, your brother," cried Anne, when the
priest paused in confusion; "let him call on us in Rome,
and I will take him to the private audience."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you, my dear madam, but my
brother is not going to Rome. It is to America I refer.
His bishop has selected him from among many eminent
priests of the diocese to make a collecting tour in America
this winter. And I feel sure that if a lady of your rank
took an interest in him, it would save him much labor,
and, what I fear is unavoidable, hardship."</p>

<p>Anne rose up delighted and came toward Father Roslyn
with a smile. She placed her hand lightly on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Father dear, whisper."</p>

<p>He bent forward. There was not a soul within hearing
distance, but Anne loved a dramatic effect.</p>

<p>"He need never leave New York. I'll see that Father
William has the <i>entrée</i> into the diocese, and I'll take care
of him until he leaves for home."</p>

<p>She tapped him on the shoulder with her jeweled finger,
and gave him a most expressive look of assurance.</p>

<p>"Oh, how you overwhelm me," cried Father Roslyn.
"I thank you a hundred times, but I won't accept so kind
an offer unless you promise me that you will preside at a
booth in the bazaar."</p>

<p>Of course she promised, much as the delay might embarrass
the American minister in London, and the Cardinal
who awaited with impatience her arrival in Rome.</p>

<p>The bazaar became a splendid legend in the parish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Cruarig; how its glory was of heaven; how Mrs. Dillon
seemed to hover over it like an angel or a queen; how
Father Roslyn could hardly keep out of her booth long
enough to praise the others; how the nobility flocked
about it every night of three, and ate wonderful dishes at
fancy prices, and were dressed like princes; and how Judy
Haskell ruled the establishment with a rod of iron from
two to ten each day, devoting her leisure to the explanation
and description of the booths once presided over by
her mistress in the great city over seas. All these incidents
and others as great passed out of mind before the
happenings which shadowed the last days at Castle Moyna
with anxiety and dread.</p>

<p>The Dowager gave a fête in honor of her guests one
afternoon, and all the county came. As a rule the gentry
sneered at the American guests of the Countess, and found
half their enjoyment at a garden fête in making fun of
the hostess and her friends in a harmless way. There
might not have been so much ridicule on this occasion
for two reasons: the children were liked, and their guardian
was dreaded. Anne had met and vanquished her
critics in the lists of wit and polite insolence. Then a few
other Americans, discovered by Captain Sydenham, were
present, and bore half the brunt of public attention. The
Dillons met their countrymen for a moment and forgot
them, even forgot the beautiful woman whose appearance
held the eyes of the guests a long time. Captain Sydenham
was interesting them in a pathetic story of battle
and death which had just happened only a few miles away.
When the two boys were dead beside the stream in the
glen, and the tourists had met their fate before the
magistrate in Cruarig, he closed the story by saying,</p>

<p>"And now down in the hotel is the loveliest Irish girl
you ever saw, waiting with the most patient grief for the
help which will release her father from jail. Am I not
right, Mrs. Endicott?"</p>

<p>The beautiful American looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she replied in a clear, rich voice. "It
is long since I met a woman that impressed me more than
this lonely creature. The Captain was kind enough to
take me to see her, that I might comfort her a little. But
she seemed to need little comfort. Very self-possessed
you know. Used to that sort of thing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"The others got scot free, no thanks to old Folsom,"
said the Captain, "and one went off to their yacht and
the other intended to start for Dublin to interest the
secretary. The Countess should interest herself in her.
Egad, don't you know, it's worth the trouble to take an
interest in such a girl as Honora Ledwith."</p>

<p>"Honora Ledwith," said the Dowager at a little distance.
"What do you know of my lovely Honora?"</p>

<p>Already in the course of the story a suspicion had been
shaping itself in Anne's mind. The ship must have arrived,
it was time to hear from Arthur and his party; the
story warned her that a similar fate might have overtaken
her friends. Then she braced herself for the shock which
came with Honora's name; and at the same moment, as
in a dream, she saw Arthur swinging up the lawn towards
her group; whereupon she gave a faint shriek, and rose
up with a face so pale that all stretched out hands to her
assistance; but Arthur was before them, as she tottered
to him, and caught her in his arms. After a moment of
silence, Mona and Louis ran to his side, Captain Sydenham
said some words, and then the little group marched off the
lawn to the house, leaving the Captain to explain matters,
and to wonder at the stupidity which had made him overlook
the similarity in names.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know," said he to Mrs. Endicott,
"her son was one of the party of tourists that Folsom
sent to jail, and I never once connected the names. Absurd
and stupid on my part."</p>

<p>"Charming young man," said the lady, as she excused
herself and went off. Up in one of the rooms of Castle
Moyna, when the excitement was over and the explanations
briefly made, Mona at the window described to
Arthur the people of distinction, as they made their adieus
to their hostess and expressed sympathy with the sudden
and very proper indisposition of Mrs. Dillon. He could
not help thinking how small the world is, what a puzzle
is the human heart, how weird is the life of man.</p>

<p>"There she is now," cried Mona, pointing to Mrs.
Endicott and an old lady, who were bidding adieu to the
Countess of Skibbereen. "A perfectly lovely face, a
striking figure&mdash;oh, why should Captain Sydenham say
our Honora was the loveliest girl he ever saw?&mdash;and he
saw them together you know&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Saw whom together?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Endicott called on Honora at the hotel,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>He leaned out of the window and took a long look at
her with scarcely an extra beat of the heart, except for
the triumph of having met her face to face and remained
unknown. His longest look was for Aunt Lois, who loved
him, and was now helping to avenge him. Strange,
strange, strange!</p>

<p>"Well?" cried Mona eagerly.</p>

<p>"The old lady is a very sweet-looking woman," he answered.
"On the whole I think Captain Sydenham was
right."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE AMBASSADOR.</h3>


<p>After the happy reunion at Castle Moyna there followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a council of war. Captain Sydenham treasonably presided,
and Honora sat enthroned amid the silent homage of her
friends, who had but one thought, to lift the sorrow from
her heart, and banish the pallor of anxiety from her lovely
face. Her violet eyes burned with fever. The Captain
drew his breath when he looked at her.</p>

<p>"And she sings as she looks," whispered the Countess
noting his gasp.</p>

<p>"It's a bad time to do anything for Mr. Ledwith," the
Captain said to the little assembly. "The Fenian movement
has turned out a complete failure here in Ireland,
and abroad too. As its stronghold was the United States,
you can see that the power of the American Minister will
be much diminished. It is very important to approach
him in the right way, and count every inch of the road
that leads to him. We must not make any mistakes, ye
know, if only for Miss Ledwith's sake."</p>

<p>His reward was a melting glance from the wonderful
eyes.</p>

<p>"I know the Minister well, and I feel sure he will help
for the asking," said Anne.</p>

<p>"Glad you're so hopeful, mother, but some of us are
not," Arthur interjected.</p>

<p>"Then if you fail with His Excellency, Artie," she replied
composedly, "I shall go to see him myself."</p>

<p>Captain and Dowager exchanged glances of admiration.</p>

<p>"Now, there are peculiarities in our trials here, trials of
rebels I mean ... I haven't time to explain them ..."
Arthur grinned ... "but they make imperative a certain
way of acting, d'ye see? If I were in Mr. Dillon's place I
should try to get one of two things from the American Minister:
either that the Minister notify Her Majesty's govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>ment
that he will have his representative at the trial of Ledwith;
or, if the trial is begun ... they are very summary
at times ... that the same gentleman inform the government
that he will insist on all the forms being observed."</p>

<p>"What effect would these notifications have?" Arthur
asked.</p>

<p>"Gad, most wonderful," replied the Captain. "If the
Minister got in his warning before the trial began, there
wouldn't be any trial; and if later, the trial would end
in acquittal."</p>

<p>Every one looked impressed, so much so that the Captain
had to explain.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to explain it to strangers&mdash;we all
know it here, doncheknow&mdash;but in these cases the different
governments always have some kind of an understanding.
Ledwith is an American citizen, for example;
he is arrested as an insurgent, no one is interested in him,
the government is in a hurry, a few witnesses heard him
talk against the government, and off he goes to jail. It's
a troublesome time, d'ye see? But suppose the other
case. A powerful friend interests the American Minister.
That official notifies the proper officials that he is going
to watch the trial. This means that the Minister is satisfied
of the man's innocence. Government isn't going to
waste time so, when there are hundreds to be tried and
deported. So he goes free. Same thing if the Minister
comes in while the trial is going on, and threatens to
review all the testimony, the procedure, the character of
the witnesses. He simply knocks the bottom out of the
case, and the prisoner goes free."</p>

<p>"I see your points," said Arthur, smiling. "I appreciate
them. Just the same, we must have every one working
on the case, and if I should fail the others must be
ready to play their parts."</p>

<p>"Command us all," said the Captain with spirit.
"You have Lord Constantine in London. He's a host.
But remember we are in the midst of the trouble, and
home influence won't be a snap of my finger compared
with the word of the Minister."</p>

<p>"Then the Minister's our man," said Anne with decision.
"If Arthur fails with him, then every soul of us
must move on London like an Irish army, and win or die.
So, my dear Honora, take the puckers out of your face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and keep your heart light. I know a way to make Quincy
Livingstone dance to any music I play."</p>

<p>The smiles came back to Honora's face, hearts grew
lighter, and Arthur started for London, with little confidence
in the good-will of Livingstone, but more in his
own ability to force the gentleman to do his duty. He ran
up against a dead wall in his mission, however, for the
question of interference on behalf of American citizens in
English jails had been settled months before in a conference
between Livingstone and the Premier, although
feeling was cold and almost hostile between the two
governments. Lord Constantine described the position
with the accuracy of a theorist in despair.</p>

<p>"There's just a chance of doing something for Ledwith,"
he said dolorously.</p>

<p>"By your looks a pretty poor one, I think," Arthur
commented.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's got to be done, doncheknow," he said irritably.
"But that da&mdash;that fool, Livingstone, is spoiling the stew
with his rot. And I've been watching this pot boil for
five years at least."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with our representative?" affecting
innocence.</p>

<p>"What's right with him would be the proper question,"
growled his lordship.</p>

<p>"In Ledwith's case the wrong is that he's gone and
given assurances to the government. He will not interfere
with their disposition of Fenian prisoners, when these
prisoners are American citizen. In other words, he has
given the government a free hand. He will not be inclined
to show Ledwith any favor."</p>

<p>"A free hand," repeated Arthur, fishing for information.
"And what is a free hand?"</p>

<p>"Well, he could hamper the government very much
when it is trying an American citizen for crimes committed
on British soil. Such a prisoner must get all the privileges
of a native. He must be tried fairly, as he would
be at home, say."</p>

<p>"Well, surely that strong instinct of fair play, that
sense of justice so peculiarly British, of which we have all
heard in the school-books, would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop it," said Lord Constantine fiercely. "In war
there's nothing but the brute left. The Fenians&mdash;may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the plague take them ... will be hung, shipped to Botany
Bay, and left to rot in the home prisons, without respect to
law, privilege, decency. Rebels must be wiped out, doncheknow.
I don't mind that. They've done me enough
harm ... put back the alliance ten years at least ... and
left me howling in the wilderness. Livingstone will let
every Fenian of American citizenship be tried like his
British mates ... that is, they will get no trial at all, except
inform. They will not benefit by their American ties."</p>

<p>"Why should he neglect them like that?"</p>

<p>"He has theories, of course. I heard him spout them
at some beastly reception somewhere. Too many Irish in
America&mdash;too strong&mdash;too popish&mdash;must be kept down&mdash;alliance
between England and the United States to keep
them down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember he was one of your alliance men," provokingly.</p>

<p>"Alas, yes," mourned his lordship. "The Fenians
threatened to make mince-meat of it, but they're done up
and knocked down. Now, this Livingstone proposes a
new form of mincing, worse than the Fenians a thousand
times, begad."</p>

<p>"Begad," murmured Arthur. "Surely you're getting
excited."</p>

<p>"The alliance is now to be argued on the plea of
defense against popish aggressions, Arthur. This is the
unkind cut. Before, we had to reunite the Irish and the
English. Now, we must soothe the prejudices of bigots
besides. Oh, but you should see the programme of His
Excellency for the alliance in his mind. You'll feel it
when you get back home. A regular programme, doncheknow.
The first number has the boards now: general
indignation of the hired press at the criminal recklessness
of the Irish in rebelling against our benign rule. When
that chorus is ended, there comes a solo by an escaped nun.
Did you ever hear of Sister Claire Thingamy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saw her&mdash;know her&mdash;at a distance. What is she to
sing?"</p>

<p>"A book&mdash;confessions and all that thing&mdash;revelations
of the horrors of papist life. It's to be printed by thousands
and scattered over the world. After that Fritters,
our home historian at Oxford, is to travel in your county
and lecture to the cream of society on the beauty of Brit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>ish
rule over the Irish. He is to affect the classes.
The nun and the press are to affect the masses. Between
them what becomes of the alliance? Am I not patient?
My pan demanded harmonious and brotherly feelings
among all parties. Isn't that what an alliance must
depend on? But Livingstone takes the other tack. To
bring about his scheme we shall all be at each other's
throats. Talk of the Kilkenny cats and Donnybrook fair,
begad!"</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you feel so badly," Arthur said, laughing.
"But see here: we're not afraid of Livingstone.
We've knocked him out before, and we can do it again. It
will be interesting to go back home, and help to undo that
programme. If you can manage him here, rely on Grahame
and me and a few others in New York, to take the
starch out of him at home. What's all this to do with
Ledwith?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said his lordship with an apology. "But
my own trouble seems bigger than his. We'll get him
out, of course. Go and see Livingstone, and talk to him
on the uppish plan. Demand the rights and privileges
of the British subject for our man. You won't get any
satisfaction, but a stiff talk will pave the way for my
share in the scheme. You take the American ground,
and I come in on the British ground. We ought to make
him ashamed between us, doncheknow."</p>

<p>Arthur had doubts of that, but no doubt at all that
Lord Constantine owned the finest heart that ever beat in
a man. He felt very cheerful at the thought of shaking
up the Minister. Half hopeful of success, curious to test
the strings which move an American Minister at the court
of St. James, anxious about Honora and Owen, he presented
himself at Livingstone's residence by appointment,
and received a gracious welcome. Unknown to themselves,
the two men had an attraction for each other.
Fate opposed them strangely. This hour Arthur Dillon
stood forth as the knight of a despised and desperate race,
in a bloody turmoil at home, fighting for a little space on
American soil, hopeful but spent with the labor of upholding
its ideals; and Livingstone represented a triumphant
faction in both countries, which, having long made
life bitter and bloody for the Irish, still kept before them
the choice of final destruction or the acceptance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Puritan gods. To Arthur the struggle so far seemed but
a clever game whose excitement kept sorrow from eating
out his heart. He saw the irony rather than the tragedy
of the contest. It tickled him immensely just now that
Puritan faced Puritan; the new striking at the old for
decency's sake; a Protestant fighting a Protestant in
behalf of the religious ideals of Papists. He had an advantage
over his kinsman beyond the latter's ken; since
to him the humor of the situation seemed more vital than
the tragedy, a mistake quite easy to youth. Arthur
stated Ledwith's case beautifully, and asked him to notify
the British officials that the American Minister would
send his representative to watch the trial.</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Livingstone. "I am content with
the ordinary course for all these cases."</p>

<p>"We are not," replied Arthur as decisively, "and we
call upon our government to protect its citizens against
the packed juries and other injustices of these Irish
trials."</p>

<p>"And what good would my interference do?" said
Livingstone. Arthur grinned.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, such a notification would open the
doors of the jail to Ledwith to-morrow. There would be
no trial."</p>

<p>"My instructions from the President are precise in
this matter. We are satisfied that American citizens will
get as fair a trial as Englishmen themselves. There will
be no interference until I am satisfied that things are not
going properly."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, then, how I am to satisfy you in
Ledwith's case?" said the young man good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I don't think you or any one else can, Mr. Dillon. I
know Ledwith, a conspirator from his youth. He is
found in Ireland in a time of insurrection. That's quite
enough."</p>

<p>"You forget that I have given you my word he was not
concerned with the insurrection, and did not know it was
so imminent; that he went to Ireland with his daughter
on a business matter."</p>

<p>"All which can be shown at the trial, and will secure
his acquittal."</p>

<p>"Neither I nor his daughter will ever be called as
witnesses. Instead, a pack of ready informers will swear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to anything necessary to hurry him off to life imprisonment."</p>

<p>"That is your opinion."</p>

<p>"Do you know who sent me here, your Excellency, with
the request for your aid?"</p>

<p>Livingstone stared his interrogation.</p>

<p>"An English officer with whom you are acquainted,
friendly to Ledwith for some one else's sake. In plain
words, he gave me to understand that there is no hope
for Ledwith unless you interfere. If he goes to trial, he
hangs or goes to Botany Bay."</p>

<p>"You are pessimistic," mocked Livingstone. "It is
the fault of the Irish that they have no faith in any government,
because they cannot establish one of their own."</p>

<p>"Outside of New York," corrected Arthur, with
delightful malice.</p>

<p>"Amendment accepted."</p>

<p>"Would you be able to interfere in behalf of my friend
while the trial was on, say, just before the summing up,
when the informers had sworn to one thing, and the
witnesses for the defense to another, if they are not shut
out altogether?"</p>

<p>"Impossible. I might as well interfere now."</p>

<p>"Then on the score of sentiment. Ledwith is failing
into age. Even a brief term in prison may kill him."</p>

<p>"He took the risk in returning to Ireland at this time.
I would be willing to aid him on that score, but it would
open the door to a thousand others, and we are unwilling
to embarrass the English government at a trying moment."</p>

<p>"Were they so considerate when our moments were
trying and they could embarrass us?"</p>

<p>"That is an Irish argument."</p>

<p>"What they said of your Excellency in New York was
true, I am inclined to believe: that you accepted the
English mission to be of use to the English in the present
insurrection."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Minister, laughing in spite of himself
at the audacity of Arthur, "you will admit that I have
a right to pay back the Irish for my defeat at the
polls."</p>

<p>"You are our representative and defender," replied
Arthur gravely, "and yet you leave us no alternative but
to appeal to the English themselves."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Livingstone began to look bored, because irritation
scorched him and had to be concealed. Arthur rose.</p>

<p>"We are to understand, then, the friends of Ledwith,
that you will do nothing beyond what is absolutely required
by the law, and after all formalities are complied
with?" he said.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"We shall have to depend on his English friends, then.
It will look queer to see Englishmen take up your duty
where you deserted it."</p>

<p>The Minister waved his hand to signify that he had
enough of that topic, but the provoking quality of Arthur's
smile, for he did not seem chagrined, reminded him of a
question.</p>

<p>"Who are the people interested in Ledwith, may I
ask?"</p>

<p>"All your old friends of New York," said Arthur,
"Birmingham, Sullivan, and so on."</p>

<p>"Of course. And the English friends who are to take
up my duties where I desert them?"</p>

<p>"You must know some of them," and Arthur grinned
again, so that the Minister slightly winced. "Captain
Sydenham, commanding in Donegal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I met him in New York one winter&mdash;younger brother
to Lord Groton."</p>

<p>"The Dowager Countess of Skibbereen."</p>

<p>"Very fine woman. Ledwith is in luck."</p>

<p>"And Lord Constantine of Essex."</p>

<p>"I see you know the value of a climax, Mr. Dillon.
Well, good-night. I hope the friends of Mr. Ledwith will
be able to do everything for him."</p>

<p>It irritated him that Arthur carried off the honors of
the occasion, for the young man's smiling face betrayed
his belief that the mention of these noble names, and the
fact that their owners were working for Ledwith, would
sorely trouble the pillow of Livingstone that night. The
contrast between the generosity of kindly Englishmen and
his own harshness was too violent. He foresaw that to
any determined attempt on the part of Ledwith's English
friends he must surrender as gracefully as might be; and
the problem was to make that surrender harmless. He
had solved it by the time Anne Dillon reached London, and
had composed that music sure to make the Minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
dance whether he would or no. In taking charge of the
case Anne briefly expressed her opinion of her son's
methods.</p>

<p>"You did the best you could, Arthur," she said sweetly.</p>

<p>He could not but laugh and admire. Her instincts for
the game were far surer than his own, and her methods
infallible. She made the road easy for Livingstone, but
he had to walk it briskly. How could the poor man help
himself? She hurled at him an army of nobles, headed by
the Countess and Lord Constantine; she brought him
letters from his friends at home; there was a dinner at
the hotel, the Dowager being the hostess; and he was
almost awed by the second generation of Anne's audacious
race: Mona, red-lipped, jewel-eyed, sweeter than wild
honey; Louis, whose lovely nature and high purpose shone
in his face; and Arthur, sad-eyed, impudent, cynical, who
seemed ready to shake dice with the devil, and had no
fear of mortals because he had no respect for them.
These outcasts of a few years back were able now to seize
the threads of intrigue, and shake up two governments
with a single pull! He mourned while he described
what he had done for them. There would be no trial for
Ledwith. He would be released at once and sent home at
government expense. It was a great favor, a very great
favor. Even Arthur thanked him, though he had difficulty
in suppressing the grin which stole to his face
whenever he looked at his kinsman. The Minister saw
the grin peeping from his eyes, but forgave him.</p>

<p>Arthur had the joy of bringing the good news down to
Donegal. Anne bade him farewell with a sly smile of
triumph. Admirable woman! she floated above them all
in the celestial airs. But she was gracious to her son.
The poor boy had been so long in California that he did
not know how to go about things. She urged him to join
them in Rome for the visit to the Pope, and sent her love
to Honora and a bit of advice to Owen. When Arthur
arrived in Cruarig, whither a telegram had preceded him,
he was surprised to find Honora Ledwith in no way relieved
of anxiety.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to do but pack your trunk and get
away," he said. "There is to be no trial, you know.
Your father will go straight to the steamer, and the govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>ment
will pay his expenses. It ought to pay more for the
outrage."</p>

<p>She thanked him, but did not seem to be comforted.
She made no comment, and he went off to get an explanation
from Captain Sydenham.</p>

<p>"I meant to have written you about it," said the Captain,
"but hoped that it would have come out all right
without writing. Ledwith maintains, and I think he's
quite right, that he must be permitted to go free without
conditions, or be tried as a Fenian conspirator. The case
is simple: an American citizen traveling in Ireland is
arrested on a charge of complicity in the present rebellion;
the government must prove its case in a public trial, or,
unable to do that, must release him as an innocent man;
but it does neither, for it leads him from jail to the steamer
as a suspect, ordering him out of the country. Ledwith
demands either a trial or the freedom of an innocent man.
He will not help the government out of the hole in which
accident, his Excellency the Minister, and your admirable
mother have placed it. Of course it's hard on that
adorable Miss Ledwith, and it may kill Ledwith himself,
if not the two of them. Did you ever in your life see such
a daughter and such a father?"</p>

<p>"Well, all we can do is to make the trial as warm as
possible for the government," said Arthur. "Counsel,
witnesses, publicity, telegrams to the Minister, cablegrams
to our Secretary of State, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Of no use," said the Captain moodily. "You have
no idea of an Irish court and an Irish judge in times of
revolt. I didn't till I came here. If Ledwith stands
trial, nothing can save him from some kind of a sentence."</p>

<p>"Then for his daughter's sake I must persuade him to
get away."</p>

<p>"Hope you can. All's fair in war, you know, but
Ledwith is the worst kind of patriot, a visionary one,
exalted, as the French say."</p>

<p>Ledwith thanked Arthur warmly when he called upon
him in jail, and made his explanation as the Captain had
outlined it.</p>

<p>"Don't think me a fool," he said. "I'm eager to get
away. I have no relish for English prison life. But I
am not going to promote Livingstone's trickery. I am an
American citizen. I have had no part, direct or indirect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in this futile insurrection. I can prove it in a fair trial.
It must be either trial or honorable release to do as any
American citizen would do under the circumstances. If
I go to prison I shall rely on my friends to expose Livingstone,
and to warm up the officials at home who connive
with him."</p>

<p>Nor would he be moved from this position, and the
trial came off with a speed more than creditable when
justice deals with pirates, but otherwise scandalous.</p>

<p>It ended in a morning, in spite of counsel, quibbles, and
other ornamental obstacles, with a sentence of twenty
years at hard labor in an English prison. To this prison
Ledwith went the next day at noon. There had not been
much time for work, but Arthur had played his part to
his own satisfaction; the Irish and American journals
buzzed with the items which he provided, and the denunciations
of the American Minister were vivid, biting, and
widespread; yet how puerile it all seemed before the brief,
half contemptuous sentence of the hired judge, who thus
roughly shoved another irritating patriot out of the way.
The farewell to Ledwith was not without hope. Arthur
had declared his purpose to go straight to New York and
set every influence to work that could reach the President.
Honora was to live near the prison, support herself by her
singing, and use her great friends to secure a mitigation
of his sentence, and access to him at intervals.</p>

<p>"I am going in joy," he said to her and Arthur.
"Death is the lightest suffering of the true patriot.
Nora and I long ago offered our lives for Ireland. Perhaps
they are the only useful things we could offer, for
we haven't done much. Poor old country! I wish our
record of service had some brighter spots in it."</p>

<p>"At the expense of my modesty," said Arthur, "can't
I mention myself as one of the brighter spots? But for
you I would never have raised a finger for my mother's
land. Now, I am enlisted, not only in the cause of Erin,
but pledged to do what I can for any race that withers
like yours under the rule of the slave-master. And that
means my money, my time and thought and labor, and
my life."</p>

<p>"It is the right spirit," said Ledwith, trembling. "I
knew it was in you. Not only for Ireland, but for the enslaved
and outraged everywhere. God be thanked, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
poor creatures have stirred this spirit in you, lighted the
flame&mdash;it's enough."</p>

<p>"I have sworn it," cried Arthur, betrayed by his secret
rage into eloquence. "I did not dream the world was so
full of injustice. I could not understand the divine sorrow
which tore your hearts for the wronged everywhere.
I saw you suffer. I saw later what caused your suffering,
and I felt ashamed that I had been so long idle and blind.
Now I have sworn to myself that my life and my wealth
shall be at the service of the enslaved forever."</p>

<p>They went their different ways, the father to prison,
Honora to the prison village, and Arthur with all speed to
New York, burning with hatred of Livingstone. The
great man had simply tricked them, had studied the matter
over with his English friends, and had found a way to
satisfy the friends of Ledwith and the government at the
same time. Well, it was a long lane that had no turning,
and Arthur swore that he would find the turning which
would undo Quincy Livingstone.</p>

<p>He used the leisure of the voyage to review recent events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and to measure his own progress. For the first time since
his calamity he had lost sight of himself in this poetic
enterprise of Ledwith's, successful beyond all expectation.
In this life of intrigue against the injustice of power, this
endless struggle to shake the grip of the master on the
slave, he found an intoxication. Though many plans had
come to nothing, and the prison had swallowed a thousand
victims, the game was worth the danger and the failure.
In the Fenian uprising the proud rulers had lost sleep and
comfort, and the world had raised its languid eyes for a
moment to study events in Ireland. Even the slave can
stir the selfish to interest by a determined blow at his
masters. In his former existence very far had been from
him this glorious career, though honors lay in wait for
an Endicott who took to statecraft. Shallow Horace,
sprung from statesman, had found public life a bore.
This feeling had saved him perhaps from the fate of
Livingstone, who in his snail-shell could see no other
America than a monstrous reproduction of Plymouth
colony.</p>

<p>He had learned at last that his dear country was made
for the human race. God had guided the little ones of the
nations, wretched but hardy, to the land, the only land
on earth, where dreams so often come true. Like the
waves they surged upon the American shore. With ax
and shovel and plow, with sweat of labor and pain, they
fought the wilderness and bought a foothold in the new
commonwealth. What great luck that his exit from the
old life should prove to be his entrance into the very heart
of a simple multitude flying from the greed and stupidity
of the decadent aristocracy of Europe! What fitness that
he, child of a race which had triumphantly fought injustice,
poverty, Indian, and wilderness, should now be leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
for a people who had fled from injustice at home only to
begin a new struggle with plotters like Livingstone, foolish
representative of the caste-system of the old world.</p>

<p>Sonia Westfield, by strange fatality, was aboard with her
child and Aunt Lois. Her presence, when first they came
face to face, startled him; not the event, but the littleness
of the great earth; that his hatred and her crime
could not keep them farther apart. The Endicott in him
rose up for a moment at the sight of her, and to his horror
even sighed for her: this Endicott, who for a twelvemonth
had been so submerged under the new personality
that Dillon had hardly thought of him. He sighed for
her! Her beauty still pinched him, and the memory of
the first enchantment had not faded from the mind of the
poor ghost. It mouthed in anger at the master who had
destroyed it, who mocked at it now bitterly: you are the
husband of Sonia Westfield, and the father of her fraudulent
child; go to them as you desire. But the phantom
fled humiliated, while Dillon remained horror-shaken by
that passing fancy of the Endicott to take up the dream
of youth again. Could he by any fatality descend to this
shame? Her presence did not arouse his anger or his
dread, hardly his curiosity. He kept out of her way as
much as possible, yet more than once they met; but only
at the last did the vague inquiry in her face indicate that
memory had impressions of him.</p>

<p>Often he studied her from afar, when she sat deep in
thought with her lovely eyes ... how he had loved them
... melting, damnable, false eyes fixed on the sea. He
wondered how she bore her misery, of which not a sign
showed on the velvet face. Did she rage at the depths of
that sea which in an instant had engulfed her fool-husband
and his fortune? The same sea now mocked her,
laughed at her rage, bearing on its bosom the mystery
which she struggled to steal from time. No one could
punish this creature like herself. She bore her executioner
about with her, Aunt Lois, evidently returning home to
die. That death would complete the ruin of Sonia, and
over the grave she would learn once for all how well her
iniquity had been known, how the lost husband had risen
from his darkness to accuse her, how little her latest crime
would avail her. What a dull fool Horace Endicott had
been over a woman suspected of her own world! Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
beauty would have kept him a fool forever, had she been
less beastly in her pleasures. And this Endicott, down
in the depths, sighed for her still!</p>

<p>But Arthur Dillon saw her in another light, as an unclean
beast from sin's wilderness, in the light that shone
from Honora Ledwith. Messalina cowered under the halo
of Beatrice! When that light shone full upon her, Sonia
looked to his eye like a painted Phryne surprised by the
daylight. Her corruption showed through her beauty.
Honora! Incomparable woman! dear lady of whiteness!
pure heart that shut out earthly love, while God was to
be served, or men suffered, or her country bled, or her
father lived! The thought of her purified him. He had
not truly known his dear mother till now; when he knew
her in Honora, in old Martha, in charming Mona, in Mary
Everard, in clever Anne Dillon. These women would bless
his life hereafter. They refreshed him in mind and heart.
It began to dawn upon him that his place in life was
fixed, that he would never go back even though he might
do so with honor, his shame remaining unknown. It was
mere justice that the wretched past should be in a grave,
doomed never to see the light of resurrection.</p>

<p>His mother and her party shared the journey with him.
The delay of Ledwith's trial had enabled them to make
the short tour on the Continent, and catch his steamer.
Anne was utterly vexed with him that Ledwith had not
escaped the prison. Her plain irritation gave Judy deep
content.</p>

<p>"She needs something to pull her down," was her comment
to Arthur, "or she'll fly off the earth with the lightness
of her head. My, my, but the airs of her since she
laid out the ambassador, an' talked to the Pope! She
can hardly spake at all now wid the grandher! Whin
Father Phil ... I never can call him Mounsinnyory ...
an', be the way, for years wasn't I callin' him Morrisania be
mistake, an' the dear man never corrected me wanst ...
but I learned the difference over in Rome ... where was
I?... whin Father Phil kem back from Rome he gev
us a grand lecther on what he saw, an' he talked for two
hours like an angel. But Anne Dillon can on'y shut her
eyes, an' dhrop her head whin ye ask her a single question
about it. Faith, I dinno if she'll ever get over it. Isn't
that quare now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very," Arthur answered, "but give her time. So you
saw the Pope?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I did, an' it surprised me a gra'dale to find out
that he was a dago, God forgi' me for sayin' as much. I
was tould be wan o' the Mounsinnyory that he was pure
Italian. 'No,' sez I, 'the Pope may be Rooshin or German,
though I don't belave he's aither, but he's not Italian. If
he wor, he'd have the blessed sinse to hide it, for fear the
Irish 'ud lave the Church whin they found it out.'"</p>

<p>"What blood do you think there's in him?" said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"He looked so lovely sittin' there whin we wint in that
me sivin sinses left me, an' I cudn't rightly mek up me
mind afterwards. Thin I was so taken up wid Mrs.
Dillon," and Judy laughed softly, "that I was bothered.
But I know the Pope's not a dago, anny more than he's a
naygur. I put him down in me own mind as a Roman, no
more an' no less."</p>

<p>"That's a safe guess," said Arthur; "and you still have
the choice of his being a Sicilian, a Venetian, or a Neapolitan."</p>

<p>"Unless," said the old lady cautiously, "he comes of
the same stock as Our Lord Himself."</p>

<p>"Which would make him a Jew," Arthur smoothly
remarked.</p>

<p>"God forgive ye, Artie! G'long wid ye! If Our Lord
was a Jew he was the first an' last an' on'y wan of his kind."</p>

<p>"And that's true too. And how did you come to see
the Pope so easy, and it in the summer time?"</p>

<p>The expressive grin covered Judy's face as with comic
sunshine.</p>

<p>"I dunno," she answered. "If Anne Dillon made up
her mind to be Impress of France, I dunno annythin' nor
anny wan that cud hould her back; an' perhaps the on'y
thing that kep' her from tryin' to be Impress was that the
Frinch had an Impress already. I know they had, because
I heard her ladyship lamentin', whin we wor in Paris, that
she didn't get a letther of introduction to the Impress
from Lady Skibbereen. She had anny number of letthers
to the Pope. I suppose that's how we all got in, for I
wint too, an' the three of us looked like sisters of mercy,
dhressed in black wid veils on our heads. Whin we dhruv
up to the palace, her ladyship gev a screech. 'Mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
heaven,' says she, 'but I forgot me permit, an' we can't get
in to see his Holiness.' We sarched all her pockets, but
found on'y the square bit o' paper, a milliner's bill, that
she tuk for the permit be mistake. 'Well, this'll have to do,'
says she. Says I, 'Wud ye insult the Pope be shakin' a
milliner's bill in his face as ye go in the dure?' She never
answered me, but walked in an' presented her bill to a
Mounsinnyory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" Arthur asked. "I was never in
Rome."</p>

<p>"Somethin' like the man that takes the tickets at the
theayter, ou'y he's a priest, an' looks like a bishop, but he
cuts more capers than ten bishops in wan. He never
opened the paper&mdash;faith, if he had, there'd be the fine
surprise&mdash;so we wint in. I knew the Pope the minnit I set
eyes on him, the heavenly man. Oh, but I'd like to be as
sure o' savin' me soul as that darlin' saint. His eyes looked
as if they saw heaven every night an' mornin'. We
dhropped on our knees, while the talkin' was goin' on, an'
if I wasn't so frikened at bein' near heaven itself, I'd a
died listenin' to her ladyship tellin' the Pope in French&mdash;in
French, d'ye mind?&mdash;how much she thought of him an' how
much she was goin' to spind on him while she was in Rome.
'God forgive ye, Anne Dillon,' says I to meself, 'but
ye might betther spind yer money an' never let an.' She
med quite free wid him, an' he talked back like a father,
an' blessed us twinty times. I dinno how I wint in or how
I kem out. I was like a top, spinnin' an' spinnin'. Things
went round all the way home, so that I didn't dar say a
word for fear herself might think I had been drinkin'.
So that's how we saw the Pope. Ye can see now the
terrible determination of Anne Dillon, though she was the
weeniest wan o' the family."</p>

<p>In the early morning the steamer entered the lower bay,
picking up Doyle Grahame from a tug which had wandered
about for hours, not in search of news, but on the scent
for beautiful Mona. He routed out the Dillon party in
short order.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Arthur asked sleepily. "Are you here
as a reporter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As a lover," Grahame corrected, with heaving chest
and flashing eyes. "The crowd that will gather to receive
you on the dock may have many dignitaries, but I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
only lover. That's why I am here. If I stayed with the
crowd, Everard, who hates me almost, would have taken
pains to shut me out from even a plain how-de-do with my
goddess."</p>

<p>"I see. It's rather early for a goddess, but no doubt she
will oblige. You mentioned a crowd on the dock to receive
us. What crowd?"</p>

<p>"Your mother," said Doyle, "is a wonderful woman.
I have often speculated on the absence of a like ability in
her son."</p>

<p>"Nature is kind. Wait till I'm as old as she is," said
the son.</p>

<p>"The crowd awaits her to do her honor. The common
travelers <i>will land</i> this morning, glad to set foot on solid
ground again. Mrs. Montgomery Dillon and her party
are the only personages that <i>will arrive from Europe</i>.
The crowd gathers to meet, not the passengers who merely
land, but the personages who arrive from Europe."</p>

<p>"Nice distinction. And who is the crowd?"</p>

<p>"Monsignor O'Donnell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A very old and dear friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who hopes to build his cathedral with her help. The
Senator&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Representing the Dillon clan."</p>

<p>"Who did not dare absent himself, and hopes for more
inspiration like that which took him out of the ring and
made him a great man. Vandervelt."</p>

<p>"Well, he, of course, is purely disinterested."</p>

<p>"Didn't she inform him of her triumph over Livingstone
in London? And isn't he to be the next ambassador,
and more power to him?"</p>

<p>"And John Everard of course."</p>

<p>"To greet his daughter, and to prevent your humble
servant from kissing the same," and he sighed with pleasure
and triumph. "Where is she? Shall I have long to
wait? Is she changed?"</p>

<p>"Ask her brother," with a nod for the upper berth
where Louis slept serenely.</p>

<p>"And of course you have news?"</p>

<p>"Loads of it. I have arranged for a breakfast and a
talk after the arrival is finished. There'll be more to eat
than the steak."</p>

<p>The steamer swung to the pier some hours later, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Arthur walked ashore to the music of a band which played
decorously the popular strains for a popular hero returning
crowned with glory. His mother arrived as became the
late guest of the Irish nobility. Grahame handed Mona
into her father's arms with an exasperating gesture, and
then plunged into his note-book, as if he did not care.
The surprised passengers wondered what hidden greatness
had traveled with them across the sea. On the deck Sonia
watched the scene with dull interest, for some one had
murmured something about a notorious Fenian getting
back home to his kind. Arthur saw her get into a cab
with her party a few minutes later and drive away. A
sadness fell upon him, the bitterness which follows the
fading of our human dreams before the strong light of
day.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">LA BELLE COLETTE.</h3>


<p>After the situation had been discussed over the breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for ten minutes Arthur understood the mournful expression
of the Senator, whose gaiety lapsed at intervals
when bitterness got the better of him.</p>

<p>"The boys&mdash;the whole town is raving about you, Artie,"
said he with pride, "over the way you managed that
affair of Ledwith's. There'll be nothing too good for you
this year, if you work all the points of the game&mdash;if you
follow good advice, I mean. You've got Livingstone in a
corner. When this cruel war is over, and it is over for
the Fenians&mdash;they've had enough, God knows&mdash;it ought
to be commencing for the Honorable Quincy Livingstone."</p>

<p>"You make too much of it, Senator," Grahame responded.
"We know what's back of these attacks on you
and others. It's this way, Arthur: the Senator and I
have been working hard for the American citizens in
English jails, Fenians of course, and the Livingstone
crowd have hit back at us hard. The Senator, as the
biggest man in sight, got hit hardest."</p>

<p>"What they say of me is true, though. That's what
hurts."</p>

<p>"Except that they leave out the man whom every one
admires for his good sense, generous heart, and great
success," Arthur said to console him.</p>

<p>"Of course one doesn't like to have the sins of his
youth advertised for two civilizations," Grahame continued.
"One must consider the source of this abuse
however. They are clever men who write against us, but
to know them is not to admire them. Bitterkin of the
<i>Post</i> has his brain, stomach, and heart stowed away in a
single sack under his liver, which is very torpid, and his
stomach is always sour. His blood is three parts water
from the Boyne, his food is English, his clothes are a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bad fit, and his whiskers are so hard they dull the scissors.
He loves America when he can forget that Irish
and other foreign vermin inhabit it, otherwise he detests
it. He loves England until he remembers that he can't
live in it. The other fellow, Smallish, writes beautiful
English, and lives on the old clothes of the nobility. Now
who would mourn over the diatribes of such cats?"</p>

<p>The Senator had to laugh at the description despite his
sadness.</p>

<p>"This is only one symptom of the trouble that's brewing.
There's no use in hiding the fact that things are
looking bad. Since the Fenian scheme went to pieces,
the rats have left their holes. The Irish are demoralized
everywhere, fighting themselves as usual after a collapse,
and their enemies are quoting them against one another.
Here in New York the hired bravos of the press are in
the pay of the Livingstone crowd, or of the British secret
service. What can you expect?"</p>

<p>"How long will it last? What is doing against it?"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Ask me easier questions. Anyway, I'm only consoling
the Senator for the hard knocks he's getting for the sake
of old Ireland. Cheer up, Senator."</p>

<p>"Even when Fritters made his bow," said the mournful
Senator, "they made game of me," and the tears rose
to his eyes. Arthur felt a secret rage at this grief.</p>

<p>"You heard of Fritters?" and Arthur nodded. "He
arrived, and the Columbia College crowd started him off
with a grand banquet. He's an Oxford historian with a
new recipe for cooking history. The Columbia professor
who stood sponsor for him at the banquet told the world
that Fritters would show how English government worked
among the Irish, and how impossible is the Anglo-Saxon
idea among peoples in whom barbarism does not die with
the appearance and advance of civilization. He touched
up the elegant parades and genial shindys of St. Patrick's
Day as 'inexplicable dumb shows and noise,'&mdash;see Hamlet's
address to the players&mdash;and hoped the banks of our
glorious Hudson would never witness the bloody rows peculiar
to the banks of the immortal Boyne. Then he
dragged in the Senator."</p>

<p>"What's his little game?" Arthur asked.</p>

<p>"Scientific ridicule ... the press plays to the galleries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and Fritters to the boxes ... it's a part of the general
scheme ... I tell you there's going to be fun galore this
winter ... and the man in London is at the root of the
deviltry."</p>

<p>"What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"If we only knew," the Senator groaned. "If we
could only get them under our fists, in a fair and square
tussle!"</p>

<p>"I think the hinge of the Livingstone plan is Sister
Claire, the escaped nun," Grahame said thoughtfully.
"She's the star of the combination, appeals to the true
blue church-member with descriptions of the horrors
of convents. Her book is out, and you'll find a copy waiting
for you at home. Dime novels are prayer-books beside
it. French novels are virtuous compared with it. It
is raising an awful row. On the strength of it McMeeter
has begun an enterprise for the relief of imprisoned nuns&mdash;to
rescue them&mdash;house them for a time, and see them
safely married. Sister Claire is to be matron of the house
of escaped nuns. No one doubts her experience. Now
isn't that McMeeter all over? But see the book, the <i>Confessions
of an Escaped Nun</i>."</p>

<p>"You think she's the hinge of the great scheme?"</p>

<p>"She has the public eye and ear," said Grahame, thinking
out his own theory as he talked. "Her book is the
book of the hour ... reviewed by the press ... the
theme of pulpits ... the text of speeches galore ...
common workmen thump one another over it at the
bench. Now all the others, Bradford, Fritters, the Columbia
professors, Bitterkin and his followers, seem to play
second to her book. They keep away from her society,
yet her strongest backing is from them. You know what
I mean. It has occurred to me that if we got her history ... it
must be pretty savory ... and printed it ... traced
her connection with the Livingstone crowd ... it
would be quite a black eye for the Honorable
Quincy."</p>

<p>"By George, but you've struck it," cried Arthur waking
up to the situation. "If she's the hinge, she's the
party to strike at. Tell me, what became of Curran?"</p>

<p>"Lucky thought," shouted Grahame. "He's in town
yet. The very man for us."</p>

<p>"I'm going to have it out with Livingstone," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Arthur, with a clear vision of an English prison and the
patient woman who watched its walls from a window in
the town. "In fact, I <i>must</i> have it out with Livingstone.
He's good game, and I'd like to bring him back from
England in a bag. Perhaps Sister Claire may be able to
provide the bag."</p>

<p>"Hands on it," said Grahame, and they touched palms
over the table, while the Senator broke into smiles. He
had unlimited faith in his nephew.</p>

<p>"Lord Conny gave me an outline of Livingstone's program
before I left. He's worried over the effect it's
going to have on his alliance scheme, and he cursed the
Minister sincerely. He'll help us. Let's begin with Sister
Claire in the hope of bagging the whole crowd. Let
Curran hunt up her history. Above all let him get evidence
that Livingstone provides the money for her enterprise."</p>

<p>Having come to a conclusion on this important matter,
they dropped into more personal topics.</p>

<p>"Strangely enough," said Grahame cheerfully, "my
own destiny is mixed up with this whole business. The
bulwark of Livingstone in one quarter is John Everard. I
am wooing, in the hope of winning, my future father-in-law."</p>

<p>"He's very dead," the Senator thought.</p>

<p>"The art of wooing a father-in-law!&mdash;what an art!"
murmured Grahame. "The mother-in-law is easy. She
wishes her daughter married. Papa doesn't. At least in
this case, with a girl like Mona."</p>

<p>"Has Everard anything against you?"</p>

<p>"A whole litany of crimes."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with Everard?"</p>

<p>"He was born the night of the first big wind, and he
has had it in for the whole world ever since. He's perverse.
Nothing but another big wind will turn him
round."</p>

<p>Seeing Arthur puzzled over these allusions, Grahame
explained.</p>

<p>"Think of such a man having children like the twins,
little lumps of sweetness ... like Louis ... heavens! if
I live to be the father of such a boy, life will be complete
... like my Mona ... oh!"</p>

<p>He stalked about the room throwing himself into poses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of ecstasy and adoration before an imaginary goddess to
the delight of the Senator.</p>

<p>"I've been there myself," Arthur commented unmoved.
"To the question: how do you hope to woo and win
Everard?"</p>

<p>"First, by my book. It's the story of just such a fool
as he: a chap who wears the American flag in bed and
waves it at his meals, as a nightgown and a napkin; then,
he is a religious man of the kind that finds no religion to
his liking, and would start one of his own if he thought
it would pay; finally, he is a purist in politics, believes in
blue glass, drinks ten glasses of filtered water a day, which
makes him as blue as the glass, wears paper collars, and
won't let his son be a monk because there are too many in
the world. Now, Everard will laugh himself weak over
this character. He's so perverse that he will never see
himself in the mirror which I have provided."</p>

<p>"Rather risky, I should think."</p>

<p>"But that's not all," Grahame went on, "since you are
kind enough to listen. I'm going to wave the American
flag, eat it, sing it, for the next year, myself. Attend:
the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers are going to sit on
what is left of Plymouth Rock next spring, and make
speeches and read poems, and eat banquets. I am to be
invited to sing, to read the poem. Vandervelt is to see
to that. Think of it, a wild Irishman, an exile, a conspirator
against the British Crown, a subject of the Pope,
reading or singing the praises of the pilgrims, the grim
pilgrims. Turn in your grave, Cotton Mather, as my
melodious verses harrow your ears."</p>

<p>"Will that impress John Everard?"</p>

<p>"Or give him a fatal fit. The book and the poem ought
to do the business. He can't resist. 'Never was Everard
in this humor wooed, never was Everard in this humor
won.' Oh, that Shakespeare had known an Everard, and
embalmed him like a fly in the everlasting amber of his
verse. But should these things fail, I have another matter.
While Everard rips up Church and priest and doctrine
at his pleasure, he has one devotion which none
may take liberties with. He swears by the nuns. He
is foaming at the mouth over the injury and insult
offered them by the <i>Confessions</i> of Sister Claire. We expose
this clever woman. Picture me, then, the despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
suitor, after having pleased him by my book, and astounded
him with my poem, and mesmerized him with the exposure
of Claire, standing before him with silent lips but
eyes speaking: I want your daughter. Can even this perverse
man deny me? Don't you think I have a chance?"</p>

<p>"Not with Everard," said the Senator solemnly. "He's
simply coke."</p>

<p>"You should write a book, Doyle, on the art of wooing
a father-in-law, and explain what you have left out here:
how to get away with the dog."</p>

<p>"Before marriage," said the ready wit, "the girl looks
after the dog; after marriage the dog can be trained to
bite the father-in-law."</p>

<p>Arthur found the <i>Confessions of an Escaped Nun</i> interesting
reading from many points of view, and spent the
next three days analyzing the book of the hour. His
sympathy for convent life equaled his understanding of it.
He had come to understand and like Sister Mary Magdalene,
in spite of a prejudice against her costume; but
the motive and spirit of the life she led were as yet beyond
him. Nevertheless, he could see how earnestly the
<i>Confessions</i> lied about what it pretended to expose. The
smell of the indecent and venal informer exhaled from the
pages. The vital feature, however, lay in the revelation
of Sister Claire's character, between the lines. Beneath
the vulgarity and obscenity, poorly veiled in a mock-modest
verbiage, pulsated a burning sensuality reaching the
horror of mania. A well-set trap would have easy work
in catching the feet of a woman related to the nymphs.
Small wonder that the Livingstone party kept her afar off
from their perfumed and reputable society while she did
her nasty work. The book must have been oil to that
conflagration raging among the Irish. The abuse of the
press, the criticism of their friends, the reproaches of their
own, the hostility of the government, the rage and grief
at the failure of their hopes, the plans to annoy and cripple
them, scorched indeed their sensitive natures; but the book
of the Escaped Nun, defiling their holy ones so shamelessly,
ate like acid into their hearts. Louis came in, when he
had completed his analysis of the volume, and begun to
think up a plan of action. The lad fingered the book gingerly,
and said timidly:</p>

<p>"I'm going to see ... I have an appointment with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
terrible woman for to-morrow afternoon. In fact, I saw
her this morning. I went to her office with Sister Mary
Magdalen."</p>

<p>"Of course the good Sister has a scheme to convert the
poor thing!" Arthur said lightly, concealing his delight
and surprise under a pretense of indifference.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," and the lad laughed and blushed. "And
she may succeed too. The greater the sin the deeper the
repentance. The unfortunate woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is making a fortune on her book by the
way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;received us very kindly. Sister Magdalen had
been corresponding with her. She wept in admitting that
her fall seemed beyond hope. She felt so tangled in her
own sins that she knew no way to get out of them. Really,
she <i>was</i> so sincere. When we were leaving she begged me
to call again, and as I have to return to the seminary
Monday I named to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"You may then have the honor of converting her."</p>

<p>"It would be an honor," Louis replied stoutly.</p>

<p>"Try it," said Arthur after thinking the matter over.
"I know what force <i>your</i> arguments will have with her.
And if you don't object I'll stay ... by the way, where is
her office?"</p>

<p>"In a quiet business building on Bleecker Street, near
Broadway."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind I'll stay outside in the hall, and
rush in to act as altar-boy, when she agrees to 'vert."</p>

<p>"I'm going for all your ridicule, Arthur."</p>

<p>"No objection, but keep a cool head, and bear in mind
that I am in the hall outside."</p>

<p>He suspected the motive of Sister Claire, both in making
this appointment, and in playing at conversion with
Sister Magdalen. Perhaps it might prove the right sort
of trap for her cunning feet. He doubted the propriety
of exposing Louis to the fangs of the beast, and for a
moment he thought to warn him of the danger. But he
had no right to interfere in Sister Magdalen's affair,
and if a beginning had to be made this adventure could
be used effectively. He forgot the affair within the hour,
in the business of hunting up Curran.</p>

<p>He had a double reason for seeking the detective. Besides
the task of ferreting out the record of Sister Claire, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wished to get news of the Endicotts. Aunt Lois had
slipped out of life two days after her return from Europe.
The one heart that loved him truly beat for him no more.
By this time her vengeance must have fallen, and Sonia,
learning the full extent of her punishment, must now be
writhing under a second humiliation and disappointment.
He did not care to see her anguish, but he did care to hear
of the new effort that would undoubtedly be made to find
the lost husband. Curran would know. He met him
that afternoon on the street near his own house.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm back in the old business," he said proudly;
"the trip home so freshened me that I feel like myself
again. Besides, I have my own home, here it is, and my
wife lives with me. Perhaps you have heard of her, La
Belle Colette."</p>

<p>"And seen her too ... a beautiful and artistic
dancer."</p>

<p>"You must come in now and meet her. She is a trifle
wild, you know, and once she took to drink; but she's a
fine girl, a real good fellow, and worth twenty like me.
Come right in, and we'll talk business later."</p>

<p>La Belle Colette! The dancer at a cheap seaside resort!
The wild creature who drank and did things!
This shrewd, hard fellow, who faced death as others faced
a wind, was deeply in love and happy in her companionship.
What standard of womanhood and wifehood remained
to such men? However, his wonder ceased when
he had bowed to La Belle Colette in her own parlor, heard
her sweet voice, and looked into the most entrancing eyes
ever owned by a woman, soft, fiery, tender, glad, candid
eyes. He recalled the dancer, leaping like a flame about
the stage. In the plainer home garments he recognized
the grace, quickness, and gaiety of the artist. Her charm
won him at once, the spell which her rare kind have ever
been able to cast about the hearts of men. He understood
why the flinty detective should be in love with his wife at
times, but not why he should continue in that state. She
served them with wine and cigars, rolled a cigarette for
herself, chatted with the ease and chumminess of a good
fellow, and treated Arthur with tenderness.</p>

<p>"Richard has told me so much of you," she explained.</p>

<p>"I have so admired your exquisite art," he replied,
"that we are already friends."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Que vous êtes bien gentil," she murmured, and her
tone would have caressed the wrinkles out of the heart of
old age.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm back at the old game," said Curran, when
they got away from pleasantry. "I'm chasing after Tom
Jones. It's more desperate than ever. His old aunt died
some days back, and left Tom's wife a dollar, and Tom's
son another dollar."</p>

<p>"I can fancy her," said Colette with a laugh, "repeating
to herself that magic phrase, two dollars, for hours and
hours. Hereafter she will get weak at sight of the figure
two, and things that go in twos, like married people, she
will hate."</p>

<p>"How easy to see that you are French, Colette," said
Arthur, as a compliment. She threw him a kiss from her
pretty fingers, and gave a sidelong look at Curran.</p>

<p>"There's a devil in her," Arthur thought.</p>

<p>"The will was very correct and very sound," resumed
the detective. "No hope in a contest if they thought of
such a thing among the West ... the Jones'. The heirs
took pity on her, and gave her a lump for consolation.
She took it and cursed them for their kindness. Her
rage was something to see. She is going to use that lump,
somewhere about twenty-five thousand, I think, to find her
accursed Tom. How do I know? That's part of the
prize for me if I catch up with Tom Jones within three
years. And I draw a salary and expenses all the time.
You should have seen Mrs. Tom the day I went to see
her. Colette," with a smile for his wife, "your worst
trouble with a manager was a summer breeze to it. You're
a white-winged angel in your tempers compared with Mrs.
Tom Jones. Her language concerning the aunt and the
vanished nephew was wonderful. I tried to remember it,
and I couldn't."</p>

<p>"I can see her, I can feel with her," cried La Belle
Colette, jumping to her feet, and rushing through a
pantomime of fiendish rage, which made the men laugh to
exhaustion. As she sat down she said with emphasis, "She
must find him, and through you. I shall help, and so
will our friend Dillon. It's an outrage for any man to
leave a woman in such a scrape ... for a mere trifle."</p>

<p>"She has her consolations," said the detective; "but
the devil in her is not good-natured like the devil in you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Colette. She wants to get hold of Tom and cut him in
little bits for what he has made her suffer."</p>

<p>"Did you get out any plans?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"One. Look for him between here and Boston. That's
my wife's idea. Tom Jones was not clever, but she
says ... Say it yourself, my dear."</p>

<p>"Rage and disappointment, or any other strong feeling,"
said the woman sharply, with strong puffs at her cigarette,
"turns a fool into a wise man for a minute. It would
be just like this fool to have a brilliant interval while he
dreamed of murdering his clever wife. Then he hit upon
a scheme to cheat the detectives. It's easy, if you know
how stupid they are, except Dick. Tom Jones is here, on
his own soil. He was not going to run away with a
million and try to spend it in the desert of Sahara. He's
here, or in Boston, enjoying the sight of his wife stewing
in poverty. It would be just like the sneak to do her that
turn."</p>

<p>She looked wickedly at Arthur. What a face! Thin,
broad, yet finely proportioned, with short, flaxen locks
framing it, delicate eyebrows marking the brow and
emphasizing the beautiful eyes. A woman to be feared,
an evil spirit in some of her moods.</p>

<p>"You tried the same plan," Arthur began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But he had no partner to sharpen his wits," she
interrupted. Arthur bowed.</p>

<p>"That makes all the difference in the world," he said
sincerely. "Let me hope that you will give your husband
some hints in a case which I am going to give him."</p>

<p>He described the career of Sister Claire briefly, and
expressed the wish to learn as much as possible of her
earlier history. The Currans laughed.</p>

<p>"I had that job before," said the detective. "If the
Jones case were only half a hundred times harder I might
be happy. Her past is unknown except that she has been
put out of many convents. I never looked up her birthplace
or her relatives. Her name is Kate Kerrigan along
with ten other names. She drinks a little, and just now
holds a fine stake in New York ... There's the whole
of it."</p>

<p>"Not much to build upon, if one wished to worry
Claire, or other people."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," Colette broke in, "that Kate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Kerrigan has a pretty history behind her. I'll bet she was
an actress once. I've seen her stage poses ... then her
name, catchy ... and the way she rolls her eyes and
looks at that congregation of elders, and deacons and
female saints, when she sets them shivering over the
nastiness that's coming."</p>

<p>Curran glanced at her with a look of inquiry. She sat
on the window-sill like a bird, watching the street without,
half listening to the men within. Arthur made a close
study of the weird creature, sure that a strain of madness
ran in her blood. Her looks and acts had the grace of a
wild nature, which purrs, and kills, and purrs again.
Quiet and dreamy this hour, in her dances she seemed
half mad with vitality.</p>

<p>"Tell him what you learned about her," said Curran,
and then to Arthur, "She can do a little work herself,
and likes it."</p>

<p>"To hunt a poor soul down, never!" she cried. "But
when a mean thing is hiding what every one has a right
to know, I like to tear the truth out of her ... like your
case of Tom Jones. Sister Claire is downright mean.
Maybe she can't help it. But I know the nuns, and
they're God's own children. She knows it too, but, just
for the sake of money, she's lying night and day against
them, and against her own conscience. There's a devil in
her. I could do a thing like that for deviltry, and I could
pull a load of money out of her backers, not for the money,
but for deviltry too, to skin a miser like McMeeter, and a
dandy like Bradford. And she's just skinning them, to
the last cent."</p>

<p>She took a fit of laughing, then, over the embarrassment
of Sister Claire's chief supporters.</p>

<p>"Here's what I know about her," she went on. "The
museum fakirs are worshiping her as a wonderful success.
They seem to feel by instinct that she's one of
themselves, but a genius. They have a lot of fairy stories
about her, but here's the truth: Bishop Bradford and
Erastus McMeeter are her backers. The Bishop plays
high society for her, and the bawler looks after the mob.
She gets fifty per cent. of everything, and they take all the
risks. Her book, I know you read it, chock-full of lies,
thrilling lies, for the brothers and the sisters who can't
read French novels in public&mdash;well, she owns the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thing and gets all the receipts except a beggar's ten per
cent., thrown to the publishers ... and they're the crack
publishers of the town, the Hoppertons ... but all the
same they dassent let their names go on the title-page ...
they had that much shame ... so old Johnson, whom
nobody knows, is printer and publisher. The book is
selling like peanuts. There's more than one way of selling
your soul to the devil."</p>

<p>After this surprising remark, uttered without a smile,
she looked out of the window sadly, while Curran chuckled
with delight.</p>

<p>"It takes the woman to measure the woman," he said.
Arthur was delighted at this information.</p>

<p>"I wish you would learn some more about her, Mrs.
Curran."</p>

<p>She mimicked the formal name in dumb show.</p>

<p>"Well, La Belle Colette, then," he said laughing.
She came over to him and sat on the arm of his chair, her
beautiful eyes fixed on his with an expression well understood
by both the men.</p>

<p>"You are going to hunt that dreadful creature down,"
said she. "I won't help you. What do you know about
her motives? She may have good reason for playing the
part ... she may have suffered?"</p>

<p>"One must protect his own," replied Arthur grimly.</p>

<p>"What are we all but wolves that eat one another?&mdash;lambs
by day, wolves in the night. We all play our
part&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the world's a stage, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even you are playing a part," with sudden violence.
"I have studied you, young man, since you came in.
Lemme read your palm, and tell you."</p>

<p>She held his hand long, then tossed it aside with petulance,
parted his hair and peered into his face, passed her
hands lightly over his head for the prominences, dashed
unexpected tears from her eyes, and then said with decision:</p>

<p>"There are two of you in there," tapping his chest. "I
can't tell why, but I can read, or feel one man, and outside
I see another."</p>

<p>"Your instinct is correct," said Arthur seriously. "I
have long been aware of the same fact, peculiar and painful.
But for a long time the outside man has had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
advantage. Now with regard to this Sister Claire, not to
change the subject too suddenly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colette deserted his chair, and went to her husband.
She had lost interest in the matter and would not open her
lips again. The men discussed the search for Endicott,
and the inquiry into the history of Sister Claire, while the
dancer grew drowsy after the fashion of a child, her
eyes became misty, her red lips pouted, her voice drawled
faint and complaining music in whispers, and Curran
looked often and long at her while he talked. Arthur
went away debating with himself. His mind had developed
the habit of reminiscence. Colette reminded him of a
face, which he had seen ... no, not a face but a voice ...
or was it a manner?... or was it her look, which seemed
intimate, as of earlier acquaintance?... what was it?
It eluded him however. He felt happy and satisfied, now
that he had set Curran on the track of the unclean beast.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ESCAPED NUN.</h3>


<p>Sister Claire sat in her office the next afternoon awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Louis as the gorged spider awaits the fly, with desire
indeed, but without anxiety. Her office consisted of three
rooms, opening into one another within, each connected
by doors with the hall without. A solemn youth kept
guard in the antechamber, a bilious lad whose feverish
imagination enshrined Sister Claire and McMeeter on the
same altar, and fed its fires on the promises of the worthy
pair some day to send him on a mission as glorious as their
own. The furnishings had the severe simplicity of the
convent. The brilliant costume of the woman riveted the
eye by the very dulness of her surroundings. At close
view her beauty seemed more spiritual than in her public
appearances. The heavy eyebrows were a blemish indeed,
but like a beauty-spot emphasized the melting eyes and
the peachy skin.</p>

<p>The creamy habit of the nun and the white coif about
her head left only her oval face and her lovely hands
visible; but what a revelation were these of loveliness
and grace! One glance at her tender face and the
little hands would have scattered to the winds the slanders
of Colette. Success had thrilled but not coarsened the
escaped nun. As Grahame had surmised, she was now
the hinge of Livingstone's scheme. The success of her
book and the popularity of her lectures, together with
her discreet behavior, had given her immense influence
with her supporters and with the leaders. Their money
poured into her lap. She did not need it while her book
sold and her lectures were crowded.</p>

<p>The office saw come and go the most distinguished
visitors. Even the English historian did not begin to compare
with her in glory, and so far his lectures had not
been well attended. Thinking of many things with deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
pride, she remembered that adversity had divided the
leisure of her table with prosperity. Hence, she could not
help wondering how long this fine success would last.
Her peculiar fate demanded an end to it sometime. As
if in answer to her question, the solemn youth in the
antechamber knocked at her door, and announced with
decorum Mr. Richard Curran.</p>

<p>"I have made the inquiries you wanted," Curran said,
as he took a chair at her bidding. "Young Everard is a
special pet of Dillon. This boy is the apple of his eye.
And Everard, the father, is an ardent supporter of Livingstone.
I think you had better drop this affair, if you
would escape a tangle&mdash;a nasty tangle."</p>

<p>"If the boy is willing, where's the tangle, Mr. Curran?"
she answered placidly.</p>

<p>"Well, you know more about the thing than I can tell
you," he said, as if worried. "You know them all. But
I can't help warning you against this Dillon. If you lay
your hand on anything of his, I'm of opinion that this
country will not be big enough for you and him at the
same time."</p>

<p>"I shall get him also, and that'll put an end to his enmity.
He's a fine fellow. He's on my track, but you'll
see how enchantment will put him off it. Now, don't
grumble. I'll be as tender and sweet with the boy as a
siren. You will come in only when I feel that the spell
doesn't work. Rely on me to do the prudent thing."</p>

<p>That he did not rely on her his expression showed
clearly.</p>

<p>"You have made a great hit in this city, Sister Claire,"
he began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you think I am about to ruin my chances of a
fortune?" she interrupted. "Well, I am willing to take
the risk, and you have nothing to say about it. You know
your part. Go into the next room, and wait for your cue.
I'll bet any sum that you'll never get the cue. If you do,
be sure to make a quick entrance."</p>

<p>He looked long at her and sighed, but made no pretense
to move. She rose, and pointed to the third room of the
suite. Sheepishly, moodily, in silent protest, he obeyed the
gesture and went out humbly. Before that look the brave
detective surrendered like a slave to his chains. The door
had hardly closed behind him, when the office-boy solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
announced Louis, and at a sign from Sister Claire ushered
in the friend of Arthur Dillon. She received him with
downcast eyes, standing at a little distance. With a whispered
welcome and a drooping head, she pointed to a seat.
Louis sat down nervous and overawed, wishing that he had
never undertaken this impossible and depressing task.
Who was he to be dealing with such a character as this
dubious and disreputable woman?</p>

<p>"I feared you would not come," she began in a very low
tone. "I feared you would misunderstand ... what can
one like you understand of sin and misery?... but
thank Heaven for your courage ... I may yet owe to
you my salvation!"</p>

<p>"I was afraid," said the lad frankly, gladdened by her
cunning words. "I don't know of what ... but I suppose
it was distrust of myself. If I can be of any service to
you how glad I shall be!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can, you can," she murmured, turning her
beautiful eyes on him. Her voice failed her, and she had
to struggle with her sobs.</p>

<p>"What do you think I can do for you?" he asked, to
relieve the suspense.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you that later," she replied, and almost
burst out laughing. "It will be simple and easy for you,
but no one else can satisfy me. We are alone. I must tell
you my story, that you may be the better able to understand
the service which I shall ask of you. It is a short
story, but terrible ... especially to one like you ...
promise me that you will not shrink, that you will not
despise me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no right to despise you," said Louis, catching
his breath.</p>

<p>She bowed her head to hide a smile, and appeared to be
irresolute for a moment. Then with sudden, and even
violent, resolve, she drew a chair to his side, and began
the history of her wretched career. Her position was such,
that to see her face he had to turn his head; but her delicate
hands rested on the arm of his chair, clasped now,
and again twisted with anguish, and then stretched out
with upward palms appealing for pity, or drooping in despair.
She could see his profile, and watch the growing
uneasiness, the shame of innocence brought face to face
with dirt unspeakable, the mortal terror of a pure boy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the presence of Phryne. With this sport Sister Claire had
been long familiar.</p>

<p>Her caressing voice and deep sorrow stripped the tale
of half its vileness. At times her voice fell to a breath.
Then she bent towards him humbly, and a perfume swept
over him like a breeze from the tropics. The tale
turned him to stone. Sister Claire undoubtedly drew
upon her imagination and her reading for the facts, since
it rarely falls to the lot of one woman to sound all the
depths of depravity. Louis had little nonsense in his
character. At first his horror urged him to fly from the
place, but whenever the tale aroused this feeling in him,
the cunning creature broke forth into a strain of penitence
so sweet and touching that he had not the heart to desert
her. At the last she fell upon her knees and buried her
face in his lap, crying out:</p>

<p>"If you do not hate me now ... after all this ... then
take pity on me."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Arthur sauntered into the hall outside the office of
Sister Claire about half-past four. He had forgotten the
momentous interview which bid so fair to end in the conversion
of the escaped nun; also his declaration to be
within hailing distance in case of necessity. In a lucky
moment, however, the thought of Sister Mary Magdalen and
her rainbow enterprise, so foolish, so incredible, came to
his mind, and sent him in haste to the rescue of his friend.
Had Louis kept his engagement and received the vows and
the confession of the audacious tool of Livingstone? No
sound came from the office. It would hardly do for him
to make inquiry.</p>

<p>He observed that Sister Claire's office formed a suite
of three rooms. The door of the first looked like the main
entrance. It had the appearance of use, and within he
heard the cough of the solemn office-boy. A faint murmur
came from the second room. This must be the private
sanctum of the spider; this murmur might be the
spider's enchantment over the fly. What should the
third room be? The trap? He turned the knob and
entered swiftly and silently, much to the detective's surprise
and his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had no idea that door was unlocked," said Curran
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Nor I. Who's within? My friend, young Everard?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. She shoved me in here to wait until
some visitor departed. Then we are to consider a proposition
I made her," said the calm detective.</p>

<p>"So you have made a beginning? That's good. Don't
stir. Perhaps it is as well that you are here. Let me discover
who is in here with the good sister."</p>

<p>"I can go to the first room, the front office, and inquire,"
said Curran.</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>He could hear no words, only the low tones of the
woman speaking; until of a sudden the strong, manly
voice of Louis, but subdued by emotion, husky and uncertain,
rose in answer to her passionate outburst.</p>

<p>"He's inside ... my young man ... hopes to convert
her," Arthur whispered to Curran, and they laughed together
in silence. "Now I have my own suspicion as to
her motive in luring the boy here. If he goes as he came,
why I'm wrong perhaps. If there's a rumpus, I may have
her little feet in the right sort of a trap, and so save you
labor, and the rest of us money. If anything happens,
Curran, leave the situation to me. I'm anxious for a close
acquaintance with Sister Claire."</p>

<p>Curran sat as comfortably, to the eye, as if in his own
house entertaining his friend Dillon. The latter occasionally
made the very natural reflection that this brave and
skilful man lay in the trap of just such a creature as Sister
Claire. Suddenly there came a burst of sound from the
next room, exclamations, the hurrying of feet, the crash
of a chair, and the trying of the doors. A frenzied hand
shook the knob of the door at which Arthur was looking
with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>"Locked in?" he said to Curran, who nodded in a dazed
way.</p>

<p>Then some kind of a struggle began on the other side of
that door. Arthur stood there like a cat ready to pounce
on the foolish mouse, and the detective glared at him like
a surly dog eager to rend him, but afraid. They could
hear smothered calls for help in a woman's voice.</p>

<p>"If she knew how near the cat is," Arthur remarked
patiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the key clicked in the lock, the door half
opened, and as Arthur pushed it inwards Sister Claire
flung herself away from it, and gasped feebly for help.
She was hanging like a tiger to Louis, who in a gentle way
tried to shake her hands and arms from his neck. The
young fellow's face bore the frightful look of a terrified
child struggling for life against hopeless odds&mdash;mingled
despair and pain. Arthur remained quietly in the entrance,
and the detective glared over his shoulder warningly
at Claire. At sight of the man who stood there, she
would have shrieked in her horror and fright, but that
sound died away in her throat. She loosened her grip,
and stood staring a moment, then swiftly and meaningly
began to arrange her disordered clothing. Louis made a
dash for the door, seeing only a way of escape and not
recognizing his friend. Arthur shook him.</p>

<p>"Ah, you will go converting before your time," he said
gayly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, thank God&mdash;&mdash;" the lad stammered.</p>

<p>"Seize him," Claire began to shriek, very cautiously
however. "Hold him, gentlemen. Get the police. He
is an emissary of the papists&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me go," Louis cried in anguish.</p>

<p>"Steady all round," Arthur answered with a laugh.
"Sister Claire, if you want the police raise your voice.
One harlot more on the Island will not matter. Louis,
get your nerve, man. Did I not tell you I would be in
the hall? Go home, and leave me to deal with this perfect
lady. Look after him," he flung at Curran, and
closed the door on them, quite happy at the result of
Sister Magdalen's scheme of conversion.</p>

<p>He did not see the gesture from Curran which warned
Sister Claire to make terms in a hurry with this dangerous
young man. The fury stood at the far end of the
office, burning with rage and uncertainty. Having fallen
into her own trap, she knew not what to do. The situation
had found its master. Arthur Dillon evidently took
great pleasure in this climax of her making. He looked
at her for a moment as one might at a wild animal of a
new species. The room had been darkened so that one
could not see distinctly. He knew that trick too. Her
beauty improved upon acquaintance. For the second time
her face reminded him that they had met before, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
considered the point for an instant. What did it matter
just then? She had fallen into his hands, and must be
disposed of. Pointing to a chair he sat down affably, his
manner making his thought quite plain. She remained
standing.</p>

<p>"You may be very tired before our little talk is concluded&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I to receive your insults as well as your agent's?"
she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Sister Claire, this will never do. You
have been acting" ... he looked at his watch ... "since
four o'clock. The play is over. We are in real life again.
Talk sense. Since Everard failed to convert you, and you
to convert Everard, try the arts of Cleopatra on me. Or,
let me convince you that you have made a blunder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to listen you," she snapped. "I will
not be insulted a second time."</p>

<p>"Who could insult the author of the <i>Confessions</i>?
You are beyond insult, Claire. I have read your book
with the deepest interest. I have read you between every
line, which cannot be said of most of your readers. I am
not going to waste any words on you. I am going to give
you an alternative, which will do duty until I find rope
enough to hang you as high as Jack Sheppard. You know
what you are, and so do I. The friends of this young man
who fell so nicely into your claws will be anxious to keep
his adventure with you very quiet."</p>

<p>A light leaped into her eyes. She had feared that outside,
in the hall, this man might have his hirelings ready
to do her mischief, that some dreadful plot had come to a
head which meant her ruin. Light began to dawn upon
her. He laughed at her thoughts.</p>

<p>"One does not care to make public an adventure with
such a woman as you," said he affably. "A young man
like that too. It would be fatal for him. Therefore, you
are to say nothing about it. You are not eager to talk
about your failure ... Cleopatra blushes for your failure ... but
a heedless tongue and a bitter feeling often get
the better of sense. If you remain silent, so shall I."</p>

<p>"Very generous," she answered calmly, coming back to
her natural coolness and audacity. "As you have all to
lose, and I have all to gain by a description of the trap set
for me by your unclean emissary, your proposition won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
go. I shall place the matter before my friends, and before
the public, when I find it agreeable."</p>

<p>"When!" he mocked. "You know by this time that
you are playing a losing game, Claire. If you don't know
it, then you are not smart enough for the game. Apart
from that, remember one thing: when you speak I shall
whisper the truth to the excitable people whom your dirty
book is harrying now."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of whispers, quite used to them in
fact," she drawled, as if mimicking him.</p>

<p>"I see you are not smart enough for the game," and the
remark startled her. "You can see no possible results from
that whisper. Did you ever hear of Jezebel and her fate?
Oh, you recall how the dogs worried her bones, do you?
So far your evil work has been confined to glittering generalities.
To-day you took a new tack. Now you must
answer to me. Let it once become known that you tried
to defile the innocent, to work harm to one of mine, and
you may suffer the fate of the unclean things to which you
belong by nature. The mob kills without delicacy. It
will tear you as the dogs tore the painted Jezebel."</p>

<p>"You are threatening me," she stammered with a show
of pride.</p>

<p>"No. That would be a waste of time. I am warning
you. You have still the form of a woman, therefore I give
you a chance. You are at the end of your rope. Stretch
it further, and it may become the noose to hang you. You
have defiled with your touch one whom I love. He kept
his innocence, so I let it pass. But a rat like you must
be destroyed. Very soon too. We are not going to stand
your abominations, even if men like Livingstone and
Bradford encourage you. I am giving you a chance.
What do you say? Have I your promise to be silent?"</p>

<p>"You have," she replied brokenly.</p>

<p>He looked at her surprised. The mask of her brazen
audacity remained, but some feeling had overpowered her,
and she began to weep like any woman in silent humiliation.
He left her without a word, knowing enough
of her sex to respect this inexplicable grief, and to wait
for a more favorable time to improve his acquaintance.
"Sonia's mate," he said to himself as he reached the
street. The phrase never left him from that day, and
became a prophecy of woe afterwards. He writhed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
he saw how nearly the honor and happiness of Louis
had fallen into the hands of this wretch. Protected by the
great, she could fling her dirt upon the clean, and go unpunished.
Sonia's mate! He had punished one creature
of her kind, and with God's help he would yet lash the
backs of Sister Claire and her supporters.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">AN ANXIOUS NIGHT.</h3>


<p>Curran caught up with him as he turned into Broadway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
He had waited to learn if Arthur had any instructions,
as he was now to return to Sister Claire's office and
explain as he might the astounding appearance of Dillon
at a critical moment.</p>

<p>"She's a ripe one," Arthur said, smiling at thought of
her collapse, but the next moment he frowned. "She's
a devil, Curran, a handsome devil, and we must deal with
her accordingly&mdash;stamp her out like a snake. Did you
notice her?"</p>

<p>"No doubt she's a bad one," Curran answered thickly,
but Arthur's bitter words gave him a shiver, and he seemed
to choke in his utterance.</p>

<p>"Make any explanation you like, Curran. She will
accuse you of letting me in perhaps. It looks like a trap,
doesn't it? By the way, what became of the boy?"</p>

<p>"He seemed pretty well broken up," the detective answered,
"and sent me off as soon as he learned that I had
him in charge. I told him that you had the whole
business nicely in hand, and not to worry. He muttered
something about going home. Anyway, he would have no
more of me, and he went off quite steady, but looking
rather queer, I thought."</p>

<p>Arthur, with sudden anxiety, recalled that pitiful, hopeless
look of the terrified child in Louis' face. Perhaps he
had been too dazed to understand how completely Arthur
had rescued him in the nick of time. To the lad's inexperience
this cheap attempt of Claire to overcome his
innocence by a modified badger game might have the
aspect of a tragedy. Moreover, he remained ignorant of
the farce into which it had been turned.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you left him," he said, thoughtfully weighing
the circumstances. "This creature threatened him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of course, with publicity, an attack on her honor by a
papist emissary. He doesn't know how little she would
dare such adventure now. He may run away in his fright,
thinking that his shame may be printed in the papers, and
that the police may be watching for him. Public disgrace
means ruin for him, for, as you know, he is studying to be
a priest."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," Curran answered stupidly, a greenish
pallor spreading over his face. "That kind of work won't
bring her much luck."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me now that he was too frightened to
understand what my appearance meant, and what your
words meant," Arthur resumed. "He may feel an added
shame that we know about it. I must find him. Do you
go at once to Sister Claire and settle your business with
her. Then ride over to the Everards, and tell the lad, if
he be there, that I wish to see him at once. If he has
not yet got back, leave word with his mother ... keep a
straight face while you talk with her ... to send him over
to me as soon as he gets home. And tell her that if I meet
him before he does get home, that I shall keep him with
me all night. Do you see the point? If he has gone off
in his fright, we have sixteen hours to find him. No one
must know of his trouble, in that house at least, until he
is safe. Do you think we can get on his trail right away,
Curran?"</p>

<p>"We must," Curran said harshly, "we must. Has he
any money?"</p>

<p>"Not enough to carry him far."</p>

<p>"Then ten hours' search ought to capture him."</p>

<p>"Report then to me at my residence within an hour.
I have hopes that this search will not be needed, that you
will find him at home. But be quicker than ever you
were in your life, Curran. I'd go over to Cherry Street
myself, but my inquiries would frighten the Everards.
There must be no scandal."</p>

<p>Strange that he had not foreseen this possibility. For
him the escapade with the escaped nun would have been
a joke, and he had not thought how differently Louis must
have regarded it. If the lad had really fled, and his
friends must learn of it, Sister Claire's share in the matter
would have to remain a profound secret. With all their
great love for this boy, his clan would rather have seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
borne to the grave than living under the shadow of scandal
in connection with this vicious woman. Her perfidy
would add disgrace to grief, and deepen their woe beyond
time's power to heal.</p>

<p>For with this people the prejudice against impurity
was so nobly unreasonable that mere suspicion became
equal to crime. This feeling intensified itself in regard
to the priesthood. The innocence of Louis would not
save him from lifelong reproach should his recent adventure
finds its way into the sneering journals. Within
the hour Curran, more anxious than Arthur himself,
brought word that the lad had not yet reached home.
His people were not worried, and promised to send him
with speed to Arthur.</p>

<p>"Begin your search then," said Arthur, "and report
here every hour. I have an idea he may have gone to
see an aunt of his, and I'll go there to find out. What is
your plan?"</p>

<p>"He has no money, and he'll want to go as far as he
can, and where he won't be easily got at. He'll ship on
an Indiaman. I'll set a few men to look after the outgoing
ships as a beginning."</p>

<p>"Secrecy above all things, understand," was the last
admonition.</p>

<p>Darkness had come on, and the clocks struck the hour
of seven as Arthur set out for a visit to Sister Mary Magdalen.
Possibly Louis had sought her to tell the story of
failure and shame, the sad result of her foolish enterprise;
and she had kept him to console him, to put him in shape
before his return home, so that none might mark the
traces of his frightful emotion. Alas, the good nun had
not seen him since their visit to Claire's office in Bleecker
Street the day before. He concealed from her the situation.</p>

<p>"How in the name of Heaven," said he, "did you conceive
this scheme of converting this woman?"</p>

<p>"She has a soul to be saved, and it's quite saveable,"
answered the nun tartly. "The more hopeless from
man's view, the more likely from God's. I have a taste
for hopeless enterprises."</p>

<p>"I wish you had left Louis out of this one," Arthur
thought. "But to deal with a wretch like her, so notorious,
so fallen," he said aloud, "you must have risked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
too much. Suppose, after you had entered her office, she
had sent for a reporter to see you there, to see you leaving
after kissing her, to hear a pretty story of an embassy from
the archbishop to coax her back to religion; and the next
morning a long account of this attempt on her resolution
should appear in the papers? What would your superiors
say?"</p>

<p>"That could happen," she admitted with a shiver, "but
I had her word that my visit was to be kept a secret."</p>

<p>"Her word!" and he raised his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, I assure you the affair was arranged beforehand
to the smallest detail," she declared. "Of course no one
can trust a woman like that absolutely. But, as you see,
in this case everything went off smoothly."</p>

<p>"I see indeed," said Arthur too worried to smile.</p>

<p>"I arranged the meeting through Miss Conyngham,"
the nun continued, "a very clever person for such work.
I knew the danger of the enterprise, but the woman has
a soul, and I thought if some one had the courage to take
her by the hand and lead her out of her wicked life, she
might do penance, and even become a saint. She received
Miss Conyngham quite nicely indeed; and also my message
that a helping hand was ready for her at any moment.
She was afraid too of a trap; but at the last she begged
to see me, and I went, with the consent of my superior."</p>

<p>"And how did you come to mix Louis up in the thing?"</p>

<p>"He happened to drop in as I was going, and I took him
along. He was very much edified, we all were."</p>

<p>"And he has been more edified since," observed Arthur,
but the good nun missed the sarcasm.</p>

<p>"She made open confession before the three of us,"
warming up at the memory of that scene. "With tears
in her eyes she described her fall, her present remorse,
her despair of the future, and her hope in us. Most remarkable
scene I ever witnessed. I arranged for her to
call at this convent whenever she could to plan for her
return. She may be here any time. Oh, yes, I forgot.
The most touching moment of all came at the last. When
we were leaving she took Louis' hand, pressed it to her
heart, kissed it with respect, and cried out: 'You happy
soul, oh, keep the grace of God in your heart, hold to your
high vocation through any torment: to lose it, to destroy
it, as I destroyed mine, is to open wide the soul to devils.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Wasn't that beautiful now? Then she asked him in the
name of God to call on her the next day, and he promised.
He may be here to-night to tell me about it."</p>

<p>"You say three. Was Edith Conyngham the third?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, only a sister of our community."</p>

<p>He burst out laughing at the thought of the fox acting
so cleverly before the three geese. Claire must have
laughed herself into a fit when they had gone. He had
now to put the Sister on her guard at the expense of her
self-esteem. He tried to do so gently and considerately,
fearing hysterics.</p>

<p>"You put the boy in the grasp of the devil, I fear,"
he said. "Convert Sister Claire! You would better have
turned your prayers on Satan! She got him alone this
afternoon in her office, as you permitted, and made him a
proposition, which she had in her mind from the minute
she first saw him. I arrived in time to give her a shock,
and to rescue him. Now we are looking for him to tell
him he need not fear Sister Claire's threats to publish how
he made an attack upon her virtue."</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand," gasped Sister Magdalen
stupefied. What Arthur thought considerate others might
have named differently. Exasperation at the downright
folly of the scheme, and its threatened results, may have
actuated him. His explanation satisfied the nun, and her
fine nerve resisted hysterics and tears.</p>

<p>"It is horrible," she said at the last word. "But we
acted honestly, and God will not desert us. You will find
Louis before morning, and I shall spend the night in
prayer until you have found him ... for him and you ... and
for that poor wretch, that dreadful woman, more to
be pitied than any one."</p>

<p>His confidence did not encourage him. Hour by hour
the messengers of Curran appeared with the one hopeless
phrase: no news. He walked about the park until midnight,
and then posted himself in the basement with cigar
and journal to while away the long hours. Sinister
thoughts troubled him, and painful fancies. He could
see the poor lad hiding in the slums, or at the mercy of
wretches as vile as Claire; wandering about the city, perhaps,
in anguish over his ruined life, horrified at what his
friends must read in the morning papers, planning helplessly
to escape from a danger which did not exist, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in his own mind. Oh, no doubt Curran would find him!
Why, he <i>must</i> find him!</p>

<p>Across the sea in London, Minister Livingstone slept,
full fed with the flatteries of a day, dreaming of the pleasures
and honors sure to come with the morning. Down
in the prison town lived Honora, with her eyes dulled from
watching the jail and her heart sore with longing. For
Owen the prison, for Louis the pavement, for Honora and
himself the sleepless hours of the aching heart; but for
the responsible Minister and his responsible tool sweet
sleep, gilded comfort, overwhelming honors. Such things
could be only because men of his sort were craven idiots.
What a wretched twist in all things human! Why not,
if nothing else could be done, go and set fire to Claire's
office, the bishop's house, and the Livingstone mansion?</p>

<p>However, joy came at the end of the night, for the
messenger brought word that the lad had been found,
sound as a bell, having just shipped as a common sailor on
an Indiaman. Since Curran could not persuade him to
leave his ship, the detective had remained on the vessel to
await Arthur's arrival. A cab took him down to the
wharf, and a man led him along the dock to the gang-plank,
thence across the deck to a space near the forecastle,
where Curran sat with Louis in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Then it's all true ... what he has been telling me?"
Louis cried as he leaped to his feet and took the hearty
grasp of his friend.</p>

<p>"As true as gospel," said Arthur, using Judy's phrase.
"Let's get out of this without delay. We can talk about
it at home. Curran, do you settle with the captain."</p>

<p>They hurried away to the cab in silence. Before entering
Arthur wrung the hand of the detective warmly.</p>

<p>"It would take more than I own to pay you for this
night's work, Curran. I want you to know how I feel
about it, and when the time comes ask your own reward."</p>

<p>"What you have just said is half of it," the man answered
in a strange tone. "When the time comes I shall
not be bashful."</p>

<p>"It would have been the greatest blunder of your
life," Arthur said, as they drove homeward, "if you had
succeeded in getting away. It cannot be denied, Louis,
that from five o'clock this afternoon till now you made a
fool of yourself. Don't reply. Don't worry about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Just think of this gold-plate fact: no one knows anything
about it. You are supposed to be sleeping sweetly at my
house. I settled Claire beautifully. And Sister Magdalen,
too. By the way, I must send her word by the
cabby ... better let her do penance on her knees till
sunrise ... she's praying for you ... but the suspense might kill
her ... no, I'll send word. As I was saying, everything
is as it was at four o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>He chattered for the lad's benefit, noting that at times
Louis shivered as with ague, and that his hands were cold.
He has tasted calamity, Arthur thought with resignation,
and life will never be quite the same thing again. In the
comfortable room the marks of suffering became painfully
evident. Even joy failed to rouse his old self. Pale,
wrinkled like age, shrunken, almost lean, he presented a
woful spectacle. Arthur mixed a warm punch for him,
and spread a substantial lunch.</p>

<p>"The sauce for this feast," said he, "is not appetite,
but this fact: that your troubles are over. Now eat."</p>

<p>Louis made a pretense of eating, and later, under the
influence of the punch, found a little appetite. By degrees
his mind became clearer as his body rested, the wrinkles
began to disappear, his body seemed to fill out while the
comfort of the situation invaded him. Arthur, puffing his
cigar and describing his interview with Claire, looked so
stanch and solid, so sure of himself, so at ease with his
neighbors, that one could scarcely fail to catch his happy
complaint.</p>

<p>"She has begun her descent into hell," he said placidly,
"but since you are with us still, I shall give her plenty of
time to make it. What I am surprised at is that you did
not understand what my entrance meant. She understood
it. She thought Curran was due as her witness of the assault.
What surprises me still more is that you so completely
forgot my advice: no matter what the trouble and
the shame, come straight to me. Here was a grand chance
to try it."</p>

<p>"I never thought of this kind of trouble," said Louis
dully. "Anyway, I got such a fright that I understood
nothing rightly up to midnight. The terrible feeling of
public disgrace eat into me. I saw and heard people crying
over me as at a funeral, you know that hopeless crying.
The road ahead looked to be full of black clouds. I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to die. Then I wanted to get away. When I found a ship
they took me for a half-drunk sailor, and hustled me into
the forecastle in lively shape. When Curran found me
and hauled me out of the bunk, I had been asleep enjoying
the awfullest dreams. I took him for a trickster, who
wanted to get me ashore and jail me. I feel better. I
think I can sleep now."</p>

<p>"Experience maybe has given you a better grip on the
meaning of that wise advice which I repeat now: no matter
what the trouble, come to me."</p>

<p>"I shall come," said the lad with a show of spirit that
delighted Arthur. "Even if you should see me hanged
the next day."</p>

<p>"That's a fine sentiment to sleep on, so we'll go to bed.
However, remind yourself that a little good sense when you
resume business ... by the way, it's morning ... no super-sensitiveness,
no grieving, for you were straight all through ... go
right on as if nothing had happened ... and in fact
nothing has happened yet ... I can see that you understand."</p>

<p>They went to bed, and slept comfortably until noon.
After breakfast Louis looked passably well, yet miserable
enough to make explanations necessary for his alarmed
parents. Arthur undertook the disagreeable office, which
seemed to him delightful by comparison with that other
story of a runaway son <i>en route</i> in fancied disgrace for
India. All's well that ends well. Mary Everard wept
with grief, joy, and gratitude, and took her jewel to her
arms without complaint or question. The crotchety father
was disposed to have it out with either the knaves or the
fools in the game, did not Arthur reduce him to quiet by
his little indictment.</p>

<p>"There is only one to quarrel with about this sad affair,
John Everard," said he smoothly, "and that only one is
your friend and well wisher, Quincy Livingstone. I want
you to remember that, when we set out to take his scalp.
It's a judgment on you that you are the first to suffer
directly by this man's plotting. You needn't talk back.
The boy is going to be ill, and you'll need all your epithets
for your chief and yourself before you see comfort again."</p>

<p>Recalling his son's appearance the father remained silent.
Arthur's prevision came true. The physician ordered
Louis to bed for an indefinite time, having found him suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>fering
from shock, and threatened with some form of fever.
The danger did not daunt his mother. Whatever of suffering
yet remained, her boy would endure it in the shelter
of her arms.</p>

<p>"If he died this night," she said to Arthur, "I would
still thank God that sent him back to die among his own;
and after God, you, son dear, who have been more than a
brother to him."</p>

<p>Thus the items in his account with kinsman Livingstone
kept mounting daily.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE END OF A MELODRAMA.</h3>


<p>Louis kept his bed for some weeks, and suffered a slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
convalescence. Private grief must give way to public
necessity. In this case the private grief developed a public
necessity. Arthur took pains to tell his story to the
leaders. It gave point to the general onslaught now being
made on the Irish by the hired journals, the escaped nun,
and, as some named him, the escaped historian. A plan
was formulated to deal with all three. Grahame entered
the lists against Bitterkin and Smallish, Vandervelt denounced
the <i>Confessions</i> and its author at a banquet <i>vis-à-vis</i>
with Bradford, and Monsignor pursued the escaped historian
by lecturing in the same cities, and often on the same
platform. Arthur held to Sister Claire as his specialty, as
the hinge of the Livingstone scheme, a very rotten hinge
on which to depend. Nevertheless, she kept her footing
for months after her interview with him.</p>

<p>Curran had laid bare her life and exposed her present
methods nicely; but neither afforded a grip which might
shake her, except inasmuch as it gave him an unexpected
clue to the Claire labyrinth. Her history showed that
she had often played two parts in the same drama. Without
doubt a similar trick served her now, not only to indulge
her riotous passions, but to glean advantages from
her enemies and useful criticism from her friends. He
cast about among his casual acquaintance for characters
that Claire might play. Edith Conyngham? Not impossible!
The Brand who held forth at the gospel hall?
Here was a find indeed! Comparing the impressions left
upon him by these women, as a result he gave Curran the
commission to watch and study the daily living of Edith
Conyngham. Even this man's nerve shook at a stroke so
luckily apt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know much about the ways of escaped nuns,"
said Arthur, "but I am going to study them. I'll wager
you find Claire behind the rusty garments of this obscure,
muddy, slimy little woman. They have the same appetite
anyway."</p>

<p>This choice bit of news, carried at once to the escaped
nun, sounded in Sister Claire's ear like the crack of doom,
and she stared at Curran, standing humbly in her office,
with distorted face.</p>

<p>"Is this the result of your clever story-telling, Dick
Curran?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"It's the result of your affair with young Everard," he
replied sadly. "That was a mistake altogether. It waked
up Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>"The mistake was to wake that man," she said sourly.
"I fear him. There's something hiding in him, something
terrible, that looks out of his eyes like a ghost in
hell. The dogs ... Jezebel ... that was his threat ... ugh!"</p>

<p>"He has waked up the whole crowd against you and
frightened your friends. If ever he tells the Clan-na-Gael
about young Everard, your life won't be worth a pin."</p>

<p>"With you to defend me?" ironically.</p>

<p>"I could only die with you ... against that crowd."</p>

<p>"And you would," she said with conviction, tears in
her eyes. "My one friend."</p>

<p>His cheeks flushed and his eyes sparkled at the fervent
praise of his fidelity.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all up with me," changing to a mood of gaiety.
"The Escaped Nun must escape once more. They will
all turn their coldest shoulders to me, absolutely frightened
by this Irish crowd, to which we belong after all, Dick. I'm
not sorry they can stand up for themselves, are you? So,
there's nothing to do but take up the play, and begin
work on it in dead earnest."</p>

<p>"It's a bad time," Curran ventured, as she took a manuscript
from a desk. "But you know how to manage such
things, you are so clever," he hastened to add, catching a
fiery glance from her eye. "Only you must go with
caution."</p>

<p>"It's a fine play," she said, turning the pages of the
manuscript. "Dick, you are little short of a genius. If
I had not liked the real play so well, playing to the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
world this rôle of escaped nun, I would have taken it up
long ago. The little stage of the theater is nothing to
the grand stage of the world, where a whole nation applauds;
and men like the Bishop take it for the real
thing, this impersonation of mine. But since I am
shut out ... and my curse on this Arthur Dillon ... no,
no, I take that back ... he's a fine fellow, working
according to his nature ... since he will shut me out I
must take to the imitation stage. Ah, but the part is fine!
First act: the convent garden, the novice reading her
love in the flowers, the hateful old mother superior choking
her to get her lover's note from her, the reading of the
note, and the dragging of the novice to her prison cell,
down in the depths of the earth. How that will draw the
tears from the old maids of Methodism all over the
country!"</p>

<p>She burst into hearty laughter.</p>

<p>"Second act: the dungeon, the tortures, old superior
again, and the hateful hag who is in love with the hero
and would like to wreak her jealousy on me, poor thing,
all tears and determination. I loathe the two women. I
denounce the creed which invents such tortures. I lie
down to die in the dungeon while the music moans and
the deacons and their families in the audience groan.
Don't you think, Dicky dear, I can do the dying act to
perfection?"</p>

<p>"On the stage perfectly."</p>

<p>"You're a wretch," she shrieked with sudden rage.
"You hint at the night I took a colic and howled for the
priest, when you know it was only the whisky and the delirium.
How dare you!"</p>

<p>"It slipped on me," he said humbly.</p>

<p>"The third act is simply beautiful: chapel of the convent,
a fat priest at the altar, all the nuns gathered about
to hear the charges against me, I am brought in bound,
pale, starved, but determined; the trial, the sentence,
the curse ... oh, that scene is sublime, I can see Booth in
it ... pity we can't have him ... then the inrush of my
lover, the terror, the shrieks, the confusion, as I am carried
off the stage with the curtain going down. At last the serene
fourth act: another garden, the villains all punished,
my lover's arms about me, and we two reading the flowers
as the curtain descends. Well," with a sigh of pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
"if that doesn't take among the Methodists and the general
public out West and down South, what will?"</p>

<p>"I can see the fire with which you will act it," said
Curran eagerly. "You are a born actress. Who but
you could play so many parts at once?"</p>

<p>"And yet," she answered dreamily, giving an expressive
kick with unconscious grace, "this is what I like best.
If it could be introduced into the last act ... but of course
the audiences wouldn't tolerate it, dancing. Well," waking
up suddenly to business, "are you all ready for the
<i>grand coup</i>&mdash;press, manager, all details?"</p>

<p>"Ready long ago."</p>

<p>"Here then is the program, Dicky dear. To-morrow
I seek the seclusion of the convent at Park Square&mdash;isn't
<i>seclusion</i> good? To-night letters go out to all my
friends, warning them of my utter loneliness, and dread
of impending abduction. In two or three days you get a
notice in the papers about these letters, and secure interviews
with the Bishop if possible, with McMeeter anyway ... oh,
he'll begin to howl as soon as he gets his letter.
Whenever you think the public interest, or excitement, is
at its height, then you bring your little ladder to the convent,
and wait outside for a racket which will wake the neighborhood.
In the midst of it, as the people are gathering, up
with the ladder, and down with me in your triumphant
arms. Pity we can't have a calcium light for that scene.
If there should be any failure ... of course there can't
be ... then a note of warning will reach me, with any
instructions you may wish to give me ... to the old
address of course."</p>

<p>Both laughed heartily at this allusion.</p>

<p>"It has been great fun," she said, "fooling them all right
and left. That Dillon is suspicious though ... fine fellow
... I like him. Dicky, ... you're not jealous. What
a wonder you are, dear old faithful Dicky, my playwright,
manager, lover, detective, everything to me. Well, run
along to your work. We strike for fortune this time&mdash;for
fortune and for fame. You will not see me again until
you carry me down the ladder from the convent window.
What a lark! And there's money in it for you and me."</p>

<p>He dared not discourage her, being too completely her
slave, like wax in her hands; and he believed, too, that
her scheme of advertising the drama of <i>The Escaped Nun</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
would lead to splendid and profitable notoriety. A real
escape, from a city convent, before the very eyes of respectable
citizens, would ring through the country like an
alarm, and set the entire Protestant community in motion.
While he feared, he was also dazzled by the brilliancy of
the scheme.</p>

<p>It began very well. The journals one morning announced
the disappearance of Sister Claire, and described
the alarm of her friends at her failure to return. Thereupon
McMeeter raised his wonderful voice over the letter
sent him on the eve of her flight, and printed the pathetic
epistle along with his denunciation of the cowardice which
had given her over to her enemies. Later Bishop Bradford,
expressing his sympathy in a speech to the Dorcas'
Society, referred to the walling up of escaped nuns during
the dark ages. A little tide of paragraphs flowed from
the papers, plaintively murmuring the one sad strain: the
dear sister could not be far distant; she might be in the
city, deep in a convent dungeon; she had belonged to
the community of the Good Shepherd, whose convent
stood in Morris Street, large enough, sufficiently barred
with iron to suggest dungeons; the escaped one had often
expressed her dread of abduction; the convents ought to be
examined suddenly and secretly; and so on without end.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of it?" said Monsignor. "I
thought you had extinguished her, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Another scheme of course. I was too merciful with
her, I imagine. All this noise seems to have one aim: to
direct attention to these convents. Now if she were hidden
in any of them, and a committee should visit that
convent and find her forcibly detained, as she would call
it; or if she could sound a fire alarm and make a spectacular
escape at two in the morning, before the whole
world, what could be said about it?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather late in history for such things?" said
Monsignor.</p>

<p>"A good trick is as good to-day as a thousand years
ago. I can picture you explaining to the American citizen,
amid the howls of McMeeter and the purring speeches
of the Bishop, how Sister Claire came to be in the convent
from which her friends rescued her."</p>

<p>"It would be awkward enough I admit. You think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>then, that she ... but what could be her motive?"</p>

<p>"Notoriety, and the sympathy of the people. I would
like to trip her up in this scheme, and hurl her once for
all into the hell which she seems anxious to prepare for
other people. You Catholics are altogether too easy with
the Claires and the McMeeters. Hence the tears of the
Everards."</p>

<p>"We are so used to it," said the priest in apology.
"It would be foolish, however, not to heed your warning.
Go to the convents of the city from me, and put them on
their guard. Let them dismiss all strangers and keep
out newcomers until the danger appears to be over."</p>

<p>The most careful search failed to reveal a trace of
Sister Claire's hiding-place among the various communities,
who were thrown into a fever of dread by the warning.
The journals kept up their crescendo of inquiry and information.
One must look for that snake, Arthur thought,
not with the eyes, but through inspiration. She hid
neither in the clouds nor in Arizona, but in the grass at
their feet. Seeking for inspiration, he went over the
ground a second time with Sister Magdalen, who had lost
flesh over the shame of her dealings with Claire, the
Everard troubles, and the dread of what was still to come.
She burned to atone for her holy indiscretions. The Park
Square convent, however, held no strangers. In the home
attached to it were many poor women, but all of them
known. Edith Conyngham the obscure, the mute, the
humble, was just then occupying a room in the place,
making a retreat of ten days in charge of Sister Magdalen.
At this fact Arthur was seized by his inspiration.</p>

<p>"She must give up her retreat and leave the place," he
said quietly, though his pulse was bounding. "Make no
objection. It's only a case of being too careful. Leave
the whole matter to me. Say nothing to her about it.
To-night the good creature will have slipped away without
noise, and she can finish her retreat later. It's absurd,
but better be absurd than sorry."</p>

<p>And Sister Magdalen, thinking of the long penance
she must undergo for her folly, made only a polite objection.
He wrote out a note at once in a disguised
hand, giving it no signature:</p>

<div class="blockquote">"The game is up. You cannot get out of the convent too quick
or too soon. At ten o'clock a cab will be at the southwest corner
of Park Square. Take it and drive to the office. Before
ten I shall be with you. Don't delay an instant. State prison is
in sight. Dillon is on your track."</div>

<p>"At eight o'clock this evening where will Miss Conyngham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be, Sister?"</p>

<p>"In her room," said the nun, unhappy over the treatment
intended for her client, "preparing her meditation
for the morning. She has a great love for meditation on
the profound mysteries of religion."</p>

<p>"Glad to know it," he said dryly. "Well, slip this
note under her door, make no noise, let no one see you,
give her no hint of your presence. Then go to bed and
pray for us poor sinners out in the wicked world."</p>

<p>One must do a crazy thing now and then, under cover
of the proprieties, if only to test one's sanity. Edith and
Claire, as he had suggested to Curran, might be the same
person. What if Claire appeared tall, portly, resonant,
youthful, abounding in life, while Edith seemed mute,
old, thin, feeble? The art of the actor can work miracles
in personal appearance. A dual life provided perfect security
in carrying out Claire's plans, and it matched the
daring of the Escaped Nun to live as Edith in the very
hearts of the people she sought to destroy. Good sense
opposed his theory of course, but he made out a satisfactory
argument for himself. How often had Sister
Claire puzzled him by her resemblance to some one whom
he could not force out of the shadows of memory! Even
now, with the key of the mystery in his hands, he could
see no likeness between them. Yet no doubt remained in
his mind that a dual life would explain and expose Sister
Claire.</p>

<p>That night he sat on the seat of a cab in proper
costume, at the southwest corner of Park Square. The
convent, diagonally opposite, was dark and silent at nine
o'clock; and far in the rear, facing the side street, stood
the home of the indigent, whose door would open for the
exit of a clever actress at ten o'clock, or, well closed, reproach
him for his stupidity. The great front of the convent,
dominating the Square, would have been a fine
stage for the scene contemplated by Sister Claire, and he
laughed at the spectacle of the escaped one leaping from
a window into her lover's arms, or sliding down a rope
amid the cheers of the mob and the shrieks of the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>graced
poor souls within. Then he gritted his teeth at
the thought of Louis, and Mary his mother, and Mona his
sister. His breath came short. Claire was a woman,
but some women are not dishonored by the fate of
Jezebel.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o'clock a small, well-wrapped figure
turned the remote corner of the Home, came out to the
Square, saw the cab, and coming forward with confidence
opened the door and stepped in. As Arthur drove off the
blood surged to his head and his heart in a way that made
his ears sing. It seemed impossible that the absurd should
turn out wisdom at the first jump. As he drove along he
wondered over the capacities of art. No two individuals
could have been more unlike in essentials than Edith
Conyngham and Sister Claire. Now it would appear that
high-heeled shoes, padded clothes, heavy eyebrows, paint,
a loud and confident voice, a bold manner, and her beautiful
costume had made Sister Claire; while shoes without
heels, rusty clothes, a gray wig, a weak voice, and timid
manner, had given form to Edith Conyngham.</p>

<p>A soul is betrayed by its sins. The common feature of the
two characters was the sensuality which, neither in the
nun nor in her double, would be repressed or disguised.
Looking back, Arthur could see some points of resemblance
which might have betrayed the wretch to a clever
detective. Well, he would settle all accounts with her
presently, and he debated only one point, the flinging of
her to the dogs. In twenty minutes they reached the
office of the Escaped Nun. He opened the door of the
cab and she stepped out nervously, but walked with decision
into the building, for which she had the keys.</p>

<p>"Anything more, mum?" he said respectfully.</p>

<p>"Come right in, and light up for me," she said ungraciously,
in a towering rage. He found his way to the gas
jets and flooded the office with the light from four. She
pulled down the curtains, and flung aside her rusty shawl.
At the same moment he flung an arm about her, and with
his free hand tore the gray wig from her head, and shook
free the mass of yellow hair which lay beneath it. Then
he flung her limp into the nearest chair, and stood gazing
at her, frozen with amaze. She cowered, pale with the
sudden fright of the attack. It was not Sister Claire who
stood revealed, but the charming and lovely La Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Colette. The next instant he laughed like a hysterical
woman.</p>

<p>"By heavens, but that <i>was</i> an inspiration!" he exclaimed.
"Don't be frightened, beautiful Colette. I was
prepared for a tragedy, but this discovery reveals a farce."</p>

<p>Her terror gave way to stupefaction when she recognized
him.</p>

<p>"So it's three instead of two," he went on. "The
lovely dancer is also the Escaped Nun and the late Edith
Conyngham. And Curran knew it of course, who was our
detective. That's bad. But Judy Haskell claims you as
a goddaughter. You are Curran's wife. You are Sister
Magdalen's poor friend. You are Katharine Kerrigan.
You are Sister Claire. You are Messalina. La Belle
Colette, you are the very devil."</p>

<p>She recovered from her fright at his laugh, in which
some amusement tinkled, and also something terrible.
They were in a lonely place, he had made the situation,
and she felt miserably helpless.</p>

<p>"You need not blame Curran," she said decisively.
"He knew the game, but he has no control over me. I
want to go home, and I want to know right away your
terms. It's all up with me. I confess. But let me know
what you are going to do with me."</p>

<p>"Take you home to your husband," said Arthur.
"Come."</p>

<p>They drove to the little apartment where Curran lay
peacefully sleeping, and where he received his erratic wife
with stupor. The three sat down in the parlor to discuss
the situation, which was serious enough, though Arthur
now professed to take it lightly. Colette stared at him
like a fascinated bird and answered his questions humbly.</p>

<p>"It's all very simple," said she. "I am truly Edith
Conyngham, and Judy Haskell is my godmother, and I
was in a convent out West. I was expelled for a love
caper, and came back to my friends much older in appearance
than I had need to be. The Escaped-Nun-racket was
a money-maker. What I really am, you see. I am the
dancer, La Belle Colette. All the rest is disguise."</p>

<p>Curran asked no questions and accepted the situation
composedly.</p>

<p>"She is in your hands," he said.</p>

<p>"I place her in yours for the present," Arthur replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
glowering as he thought of Louis. "Detectives will
shadow you both until I come to a decision what to do
with you. Any move to escape and you will be nipped.
Then the law takes its course. As for you, La Belle
Colette, say your prayers. I am still tempted to send you
after Jezebel."</p>

<p>"You are a terrible man," she whimpered, as he walked
out and left them to their sins.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE FIRST BLOW.</h3>


<p>Mayor Birmingham and Grahame, summoned by messengers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
met him in the forever-deserted offices of Sister
Claire. He made ready for them by turning on all the
lights, setting forth a cheerful bottle and some soda from
Claire's hidden ice-box, and lighting a cigar. Delight ran
through his blood like fire. At last he had his man on
the hip, and the vision of that toss which he meant to give
him made his body tingle from the roots of his hair to the
points of his toes. However, the case was not for him to
deal with alone. Birmingham, the man of weight, prudence,
fairness, the true leader, really owned the situation.
Grahame, experienced journalist, had the right to manage
the publicity department of this delicious scandal. His
own task would be to hold Claire in the traces, and drive
her round the track, show the world her paces, past the
judge's stand. Ah, to see the face of the Minister as he
read the story of exposure&mdash;her exposure and his own
shame!</p>

<p>The two men stared at his comfortable attitude in that
strange inn, and fairly gasped at the climax of his story.</p>

<p>"The devil's in you. No one but you would have
thought out such a scheme," said Grahame, recalling the
audacity, the cleverness, the surprises of his friend's career
from the California episode to the invasion of Ireland.
"Great heavens! but you have the knack of seizing the
hinge of things."</p>

<p>"I think we have Livingstone and his enterprise in the
proper sort of hole," Arthur answered. "The question
is how to use our advantage?"</p>

<p>The young men turned to Birmingham with deference.</p>

<p>"The most thorough way," said the Mayor, after complimenting
Arthur on his astonishing success, "would be to
hale Claire before the courts for fraud, and subp&oelig;na all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
our distinguished enemies. That course has some disagreeable
consequences, however."</p>

<p>"I think we had better keep out of court," Arthur said
quickly.</p>

<p>His companions looked surprised at his hesitation. He
did not understand it himself. For Edith Conyngham he
felt only disgust, and for Sister Claire an amused contempt;
but sparkling Colette, so clever, bright, and
amiable, so charmingly conscienceless, so gracefully
wicked, inspired him with pity almost. He could not
crush the pretty reptile, or thrust her into prison.</p>

<p>"Of course I want publicity," he hastened to add, "the
very widest, to reach as far as London, and strike the
Minister. How can that be got, and keep away from the
courts?"</p>

<p>"An investigating committee is what you are thinking
of," said the Mayor. "I can call such a body together at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel, our most distinguished citizens.
They could receive the confession of this woman, and report
to the public on her character."</p>

<p>"That's the plan," Arthur interrupted with joy.
"That <i>must</i> be carried out. I'll see that Claire appears
before that committee and confesses her frauds. But mark
this: on that committee you should have the agents of
Livingstone: Bradford, Bitterkin ... I owe him one
for his meanness to the Senator ... Smallish in particular,
and McMeeter for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"Wild horses wouldn't drag them to it," Grahame
thought.</p>

<p>"I have something better than wild horses, the proofs
of their conspiracy, of their league with this woman," and
Arthur pointed to the locked drawers of the office. "How
will our minister to England like to have his name connected
with this scandal openly. Now, if these people refuse
to serve, by heavens, I'll take the whole case to court,
and give it an exposure as wide as the earth. If they're
agreeable, I'll keep away from the courts, and the rougher
part of the scandal."</p>

<p>"There's your weapon," said the Mayor, "the alternative
of committee or court. I'll see to that part of the
business. Do you get the escaped nun ready for her confession,
and I'll guarantee the committee, let us say inside
of ten days. Your part, Grahame, will be to write up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
story for the morning papers, covering dramatically the
details of this very remarkable episode."</p>

<p>They sat long discussing the various features of the
scheme.</p>

<p>Next morning Curran and Arthur sat down to talk over
the terms of surrender in the detective's house. Colette
still kept her bed, distracted with grief, and wild with
apprehension over the sensational articles in the morning
papers. Curran saw little hope for himself and his wife
in the stern face of Dillon.</p>

<p>"At the start I would like to hear your explanation,"
Arthur began coldly. "You were in my employ and in
hers."</p>

<p>"In hers only to hinder what evil I could, and to protect
her from herself," the detective answered steadily and
frankly. "I make no excuse, because there isn't any to
make. But if I didn't live up to my contract with you, I
can say honestly that I never betrayed your interest. You
can guess the helplessness of a man in my fix. I have no
influence over Colette. She played her game against my
wish and prayer. Most particular did I warn her against
annoying you and yours. I was going to break up her
designs on young Everard, when you did it yourself. I
hope you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In his nervous apprehension for Colette's fate the strong-willed
man broke down. He remained silent, struggling
for his vanishing self-control.</p>

<p>"I understand, and I excuse you. The position was
nasty. I have always trusted you without knowing why
exactly," and he reflected a moment on that interesting
fact. "You did me unforgettable service in saving Louis
Everard."</p>

<p>"How glad I am you remember that service," Curran
gasped, like one who grasping at a straw finds it a plank.
"I foresaw this moment when I said to you that night,
'I shall not be bashful about reminding you of it and
asking a reward at the right time.' I ask it now. For the
boy's sake be merciful with her. Don't hand her over
to the courts. Deal with her yourself, and I'll help
you."</p>

<p>For the boy's sake, for that service so aptly rendered,
for the joy it brought and the grief it averted, he could
forget justice and crown Colette with diamonds! Curran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
trembled with eagerness and suspense. He loved her,&mdash;this
wretch, witch, fiend of a woman!</p>

<p>"The question is, can I deal with her myself? She is
intractable."</p>

<p>"You ought to know by this time that she will do
anything for you ... and still more when she has to
choose between your wish and jail."</p>

<p>"I shall require a good deal of her, not for my own
sake, but to undo the evil work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How I have tried to keep her out of that evil work,"
Curran cried fiercely. "We are bad enough as it is
without playing traitors to our own, and throwing mud on
holy things. There can be no luck in it, and she knows
it. When one gets as low as she has, it's time for the
funeral. Hell is more respectable."</p>

<p>Arthur did not understand this feeling in Curran. The
man's degradation seemed so complete to him that not
even sacrilege could intensify it; yet clearly the hardened
sinner saw some depths below his own which excited his
horror and loathing.</p>

<p>"If you think I can deal with her, I shall not invoke
the aid of the law."</p>

<p>The detective thanked him in a breaking voice. He had
enjoyed a very bad night speculating on the probable
course of events. Colette came in shortly, and greeted
Arthur as brazenly as usual, but with extreme sadness,
which became her well; so sweet, so delicate, so fragile,
that he felt pleased to have forgiven her so early in the
struggle. He had persecuted her, treated her with
violence, and printed her history for the scornful pleasure
of the world; he had come to offer her the alternative of
public shame or public trial and jail; yet she had a patient
smile for him, a dignified submission that touched him.
After all, he thought with emotion, she is of the same
nature with myself; a poor castaway from conventional
life playing one part or another by caprice, for gain or
sport or notoriety; only the devil has entered into her,
while I have been lucky enough to cast my lot with
the exorcists of the race. He almost regretted his
duty.</p>

<p>"I have taken possession of your office and papers,
Colette," said he with the dignity of the master. "I
dismissed the office-boy with his wages, and notified the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
owner that you would need the rooms no more after the
end of the month."</p>

<p>"Thanks," she murmured with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>"I am ready now to lay before you the conditions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you going to send me to jail?"</p>

<p>"I leave that to you," he answered softly. "You must
withdraw your book from circulation. You must get an
injunction from the courts to restrain the publishers, if
they won't stop printing at your request, and you must
bring suit against them for your share of the profits. I
want them to be exposed. My lawyer is at your service
for such work."</p>

<p>"This for the beginning?" she said in despair.</p>

<p>"You must write for me a confession next, describing
your career, and the parts which you played in this city;
also naming your accomplices, your supporters, and what
money they put up for your enterprise."</p>

<p>"You will find all that in my papers."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Livingstone's name among your papers?"</p>

<p>"He was the ringleader. Of course."</p>

<p>"Finally you must appear before a committee of gentlemen
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and show how you
disguised yourself for the three parts of Edith Conyngham,
Sister Claire, and the Brand of the gospel-hall."</p>

<p>She burst out crying then, looking from one man to the
other with the tears streaming down her lovely face.
Curran squirmed in anguish. Arthur studied her with
interest. Who could tell when she was not acting?</p>

<p>"Ah, you wretch! I am bad. Sometimes I can't bear
myself. But you are worse, utterly without heart. You
think I don't feel my position."</p>

<p>Her sobbing touched him by its pathos and its cleverness.</p>

<p>"You are beyond feeling, but you <i>must</i> talk about
feeling," was his hard reply. "Probably I shall make
you feel before the end of this adventure."</p>

<p>"As if you hadn't done it already," she fairly bawled
like a hurt child. "For months I have not left the house
without seeing everywhere the dogs that tore Jezebel."</p>

<p>"You might also have seen that poor child whom you
nearly drove to death," he retorted, "and the mother
whose heart you might have broken."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she sneered, and burst out laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
while the tears still lingered on her cheek. "He was a
milksop, not a man. I thought he was a man, or I never
would have offered him pleasure. And you want me to
make a show of myself before...."</p>

<p>"Your old friends and well-wishers, McMeeter, Bradford
and Co."</p>

<p>"Never, never, never," she screamed, and fell to
weeping again. "I'll die first."</p>

<p>"You won't be asked to die, madam. You'll go to jail
the minute I leave this house, and stand trial on fifty
different charges. I'll keep you in jail for the rest of
your life. If by any trick you escape me, I'll deliver you
to the dogs."</p>

<p>"Can he do this?" she said scornfully to Curran, who
nodded.</p>

<p>"And if I agree to it, what do I get?" turning again
to Dillon.</p>

<p>"You can live in peace as La Belle Colette the
dancer, practise your profession, and enjoy the embraces
of your devoted husband. I let you off lightly. Your
private life, your stage name, will be kept from the public,
and, by consequence, from the dogs."</p>

<p>She shivered at the phrase. Shame was not in her, but
fear could grip her heart vigorously. Her nerve did not
exclude cowardice. This man she had always feared,
perceiving in him not only a strength beyond the common,
but a mysterious power not to be analyzed and named.
Her flimsy rage would break hopelessly on this rock.
Still before surrendering, her crooked nature forced her
to the petty arts in which she excelled. Very clearly in
this acting appeared the various strokes of character
peculiar to Edith, Claire, and the Brand. She wheedled
and whined one moment in the husky tones of Sister
Magdalen's late favorite; when dignity was required she
became the escaped nun; and in her rage she would burst
into the melodramatic frenzy dear to the McMeeter
audiences; but Colette, the heedless, irresponsible, half-mad
butterfly, dominated these various parts, and to this
charming personality she returned. Through his own sad
experience this spectacle interested him. He subdued her
finally by a precise description of consequences.</p>

<p>"You have done the Catholics of this city harm that
will last a long time, Colette," said he. "That vile book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of yours ... you ought to be hung for it. It will live to
do its miserable work when you are in hell howling. I
really don't know why I should be merciful to you. Did
you ever show mercy to any one? The court would do
this for you and for us: the facts, figures, and personages
of your career would be dragged into the light of day ...
what a background that would be ... not a bad company
either ... not a fact would escape ... you would be
painted as you are. I'll not tell you what you are, but I
know that you would die of your own colors ... you
would go to jail, and rot there ... every time you came
out I'd have a new charge on which to send you back.
Your infamy would be printed by columns in the
papers ... and the dogs would be put on your trail ...
ah, there's the rub ... if the law let you go free, what a
meal you'd make for the people who think you ought to
be torn limb from limb, and who would do it with joy. I
really do not understand why I offer you an alternative.
Perhaps it's for the sake of this man who loves you ...
for the great service he did me."</p>

<p>He paused to decide this point, while she gazed like a
fascinated bird.</p>

<p>"What I want is this really," he went on. "I want to
let the city see just what tools Livingstone, your employer,
is willing to do his dirty work with. I want this committee
to assemble with pomp and circumstance ... those are
the right words ... and to see you, in your very cleverest
way, act the parts through which you fooled the wise. I
want them to hear you say in that sweetest of voices, how
you lied to them to get their dollars ... how you lied
about us, your own people, threw mud on us, as Curran
says, to get their dollars ... how your life, and your
book, and your lectures, are all lies ... invented and
printed because the crowd that devoured them were eager
to believe us the horrible creatures you described. When
you have done that, you can go free. No one will know
your husband, or your name, or your profession. I don't
see why you hesitate. I don't know why I should offer
you this chance. When Birmingham hears your story he
will not approve of my action. But if you agree to follow
my directions to the letter I'll promise that the law will
not seize you."</p>

<p>What could she do but accept his terms, protesting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
death was preferable? The risk of losing her just as the
committee would be ready to meet, for her fickleness
verged on insanity, he had to accept. He trusted in his
own watchfulness, and in the fidelity of Curran to keep
her in humor. Even now she forgot her disasters in the
memory of her success as an impersonator, and entertained
the men with scenes from her masquerade as Edith, Claire,
and the Brand. From such a creature, so illy balanced,
one might expect anything.</p>

<p>However, by judicious coddling and terrorizing, her
courage and spirit were kept alive to the very moment
when she stood before Birmingham and his committee,
heard her confession of imposture read, signed it with
perfect sang-froid, and illustrated for the scandalized
members her method of impersonation. So had Arthur
worked upon her conceit that she took a real pride in
displaying her costumes, and in explaining how skilfully
she had led three lives in that city. Grim, bitter,
sickened with disappointment, yet masked in smiles, part
of the committee watched her performance to the end.
They felt the completeness of Arthur's triumph. With
the little airs and graces peculiar to a stage artiste, Edith
put on the dusty costume of Edith Conyngham, and limped
feebly across the floor; then the decorous garments of
the Brand, and whispered tenderly in McMeeter's ear;
last, the brilliant habit of the escaped nun, the curious
eyebrows, the pallid face; curtseying at the close of the
performance with her bold eyes on her audience, as if
beseeching the merited applause. In the dead silence
afterwards, Arthur mercifully led her away.</p>

<p>The journals naturally gave the affair large attention,
and the net results were surprisingly fine. The house of
cards so lovingly built up by Livingstone and his friends
tumbled in a morning never to rise again. All the little
plans failed like kites snipped of their tails. Fritters went
home, because the public lost interest in his lectures. The
book of the escaped nun fell flat and disappeared from the
market. McMeeter gave up his scheme of rescuing the
inmates of convents and housing them until married. The
hired press ignored the Paddies and their island for a
whole year. Best of all, suddenly, on the plea of dying
among his friends, Ledwith was set free, mainly through
the representations of Lord Constantine in London and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Arthur in Washington. These rebuffs told upon the Minister
severely. He knew from whose strong hand they
came, and that the same hand would not soon tire of
striking.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ANNE MAKES HISTORY.</h3>


<p>In the months that followed Anne Dillon lived as near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to perfect felicity as earthly conditions permit. A countess
and a lord breathed under her roof, ate at her table,
and talked prose and poetry with her as freely as Judy
Haskell. The Countess of Skibbereen and Lord Constantine
had accompanied the Ledwiths to America, after
Owen's liberation from jail, and fallen victims to the wiles
of this clever woman. Arthur might look after the insignificant
Ledwiths. Anne would have none of them. She
belonged henceforth to the nobility. His lordship was
bent on utilizing his popularity with the Irish to further
the cause of the Anglo-American Alliance. As the friend
who had stood by the Fenian prisoners, not only against
embittered England, but against indifferent Livingstone,
he was welcomed; and if he wanted an alliance, or an
heiress, or the freedom of the city, or anything which the
Irish could buy for him, he had only to ask in order to
receive. Anne sweetly took the responsibility off his
shoulders, after he had outlined his plans.</p>

<p>"Leave it all to me," said she. "You shall win the
support of all these people without turning your hand over."</p>

<p>"You may be sure she'll do it much better than you
will," was the opinion of the Countess, and the young man
was of the same mind.</p>

<p>She relied chiefly on Doyle Grahame for one part of her
programme, but that effervescent youth had fallen into a
state of discouragement which threatened to leave him
quite useless. He shook his head to her demand for a
column in next morning's <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>"Same old story ... the Countess and you ...
lovely costumes ... visits ... it won't go. The
editors are wondering why there's so much of you."</p>

<p>"Hasn't it all been good?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, or it would not have been printed. But
there must come an end sometime. What's your aim anyway?"</p>

<p>"I want a share in making history," she said slyly.</p>

<p>"Take a share in making mine," he answered morosely,
and thereupon she landed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, run away with Mona, if you're thinking of marrying."</p>

<p>"Thinking of it! Talking of it! That's as near as I
can get to it," he groaned. "John Everard is going to
drive a desperate bargain with me. I wrote a book,
I helped to expose Edith Conyngham, I drove Fritters
out of the country with my ridicule, I shocked Bradford,
and silenced McMeeter; and I have failed to move that
wretch. All I got out of my labors was permission
to sit beside Mona in her own house with her father
present."</p>

<p>"You humor the man too much," Anne said with a
laugh. "I can twist John Everard about my finger,
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There it is," cried Grahame. "Behold it in its naked
simplicity! Only! Well, if anything short of the divine
can get around, over, under, through, or by his sweet,
little 'only,' he's fit to be the next king of Ireland. What
have I not done to do away with it? Once I thought, I
hoped, that the invitation to read the poem on the landing
of the Pilgrim Fathers, coming as a climax to multitudinous
services, would surely have fetched him. Now,
with the invitation in my pocket, I'm afraid to mention it.
What if he should scorn it?"</p>

<p>"He won't if I say the word. Give me the column to-morrow,
and any time I want it for a month or two, and
I'll guarantee that John Everard will do the right thing
by you."</p>

<p>"You can have the column. What do you want it for?"</p>

<p>"The alliance, of course. I'm in the business of making
history, as I told you. Don't open your mouth quite so
wide, please. There's to be a meeting of the wise in this
house, after a dinner, to express favorable opinions about
the alliance. Then in a month or two a distinguished
peer, member of the British Cabinet, is coming over to
sound the great men on the question.... What are you
whistling for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got a fine thing, Mrs. Dillon," said he. "By
Jove, but I'll help you spread this for all it's worth."</p>

<p>"Understand," she said, tapping the table with emphasis,
"the alliance must go through as far as we can make
it go. Now, do your best. When you go over to see John
Everard next, go with a mind to kill him if he doesn't
take your offer to marry his daughter. I'll see to it that
the poem on the Pilgrims does the trick for you."</p>

<p>"I'd have killed him long ago, if I thought it worth the
trouble," he said.</p>

<p>He felt that the crisis had come for him and Mona.
That charming girl, in spite of his entreaties, of his threats
to go exploring Africa, remained as rigidly faithful to her
ideas of duty as her father to his obstinacy. She would
not marry without his consent. With all his confidence
in Anne's cleverness, how could he expect her to do the
impossible? To change the unchangeable? John Everard
showed no sign of the influence which had brought
Livingstone to his knees, when Grahame and Mona stood
before him, and the lover placed in her father's hands the
document of honor.</p>

<p>"Really, this is wonderful," said Everard, impressed to
the point of violence. "You are to compose and to read
the poem on the Pilgrim Fathers?"</p>

<p>"That's the prize," said Grahame severely. He might
be squaring off at this man the next moment, and could
not carry his honors lightly. "And now that it has come
I want my reward. We must be married two weeks before
I read that poem, and the whole world must see and
admire the source of my inspiration."</p>

<p>He drew his beloved into his arms and kissed her pale
cheek.</p>

<p>"Very well. That will be appropriate," the father said
placidly, clearing his throat to read the invitation aloud.
He read pompously, quite indifferent to the emotion of his
children, proud that they were to be prominent figures in
a splendid gathering. They, beatified, pale, unstrung
by this calm acceptance of what he had opposed bitterly
two years, sat down foolishly, and listened to the pompous
utterance of pompous phrases in praise of dead heroes and
a living poet. Thought and speech failed together. If
only some desperado would break in upon him and try to
kill him! if the house would take fire, or a riot begin in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the street! The old man finished his reading, congratulated
the poet, blessed the pair in the old-fashioned style,
informed his wife of the date of the wedding, and marched
off to bed. After pulling at that door for years it was
maddening to have the very frame-work come out as if
cemented with butter. What an outrage to come prepared
for heroic action, and to find the enemy turned friend!
Oh, admirable enchantress was this Anne Dillon!</p>

<p>The enchantress, having brought Grahame into line and
finally into good humor, took up the more difficult task
of muzzling her stubborn son. To win him to the good
cause, she had no hope; sufficient, if he could be won to
silence while diplomacy shaped the course of destiny.</p>

<p>"Better let me be on that point," Arthur said when she
made her attack. "I'm hostile only when disturbed.
Lord Conny owns us for the present. I won't say a word
to shake his title. Neither will I lift my eyebrows to
help this enterprise."</p>

<p>"If you only will keep quiet," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm trying to. I'm set against alliance with
England, until we have knocked the devil out of her, begging
your pardon for my frankness. I must speak plainly
now so that we may not fall out afterwards. But I'll be
quiet. I'll not say a word to influence a soul. I'll do
just as Ledwith does."</p>

<p>He laughed at the light which suddenly shone in her
face.</p>

<p>"That's a fair promise," she said smoothly, and fled before
he could add conditions.</p>

<p>Her aim and her methods alike remained hidden from
him. He knew only that she was leading them all by the
nose to some brilliant climax of her own devising. He
was willing to be led. The climax turned out to be a dinner.
Anne had long ago discovered the secret influence
of a fine dinner on the politics of the world. The halo
of a saint pales before the golden nimbus which well-fed
guests see radiating from their hostess after dinner. A
good man may possess a few robust virtues, but the
dinner-giver has them all. Therefore, the manager of
the alliance gathered about her table one memorable evening
the leaders whose good opinion and hearty support
Lord Constantine valued in his task of winning the Irish
to neutrality or favor for his enterprise. Arthur recog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>nized
the climax only when Lord Constantine, after the
champagne had sparkled in the glasses, began to explain
his dream to Sullivan.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" said he.</p>

<p>"It sounds as harmless as a popgun, and looks like a
vision. I don't see any details in your scheme," said the
blunt leader graciously.</p>

<p>"We can leave the details to the framers of the alliance,"
said His Lordship, uneasy at Arthur's laugh.
"What we want first is a large, generous feeling in its
favor, to encourage the leaders."</p>

<p>"Well, in general," said the Boss, "it is a good thing
for all countries to live in harmony. When they speak
the same language, it's still better. I have no feeling one
way or the other. I left Ireland young, and would hardly
have remembered I'm Irish but for Livingstone. What
do you think of it, Senator?"</p>

<p>"An alliance with England!" cried he with contempt.
"Fancy me walking down to a district meeting with such
an auctioneer's tag hanging on my back. Why, I'd be
sold out on the spot. Those people haven't forgot how
they were thrown down and thrown out of Ireland. No,
sir. Leave us out of an alliance."</p>

<p>"That's the popular feeling, I think," Sullivan said to
His Lordship.</p>

<p>"I can understand the Senator's feelings," the Englishman
replied softly. "But if, before the alliance came to
pass, the Irish question should be well settled, how would
that affect your attitude, Senator?"</p>

<p>"My attitude," replied the Senator, posing as he reflected
that a budding statesman made the inquiry,
"would be entirely in your favor."</p>

<p>"Thank you. What more could I ask?" Lord Constantine
replied with a fierce look at Arthur. "I say
myself, until the Irish get their rights, no alliance."</p>

<p>"Then we are with you cordially. We want to do all
we can for a man who has been so fair to our people," the
Boss remarked with the flush of good wine in his cheek.
"Champagne sentiments," murmured Arthur.</p>

<p>Monsignor, prompted by Anne, came to the rescue of
the young nobleman.</p>

<p>"There would be a row, if the matter came up for discussion
just now," he said. "Ten years hence may see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
change. There's one thing in favor of Irish ... well,
call it neutrality. Speaking as a churchman, Catholics
have a happier lot in English-speaking lands than in other
countries. They have the natural opportunity to develop,
they are not hampered in speech and action as in Italy and
France."</p>

<p>"How good of you to say so," murmured His Lordship.</p>

<p>"Then again," continued Monsignor, with a sly glance
at Arthur, "it seems to me inevitable that the English-speaking
peoples must come into closer communion, not
merely for their own good, or for selfish aims, but to
spread among less fortunate nations their fine political principles.
There's the force, the strength, of the whole
scheme. Put poor Ireland on her feet, and I vote for an
alliance."</p>

<p>"Truly, a Daniel come to judgment," murmured
Arthur.</p>

<p>"It's a fine view to take of it," the Boss thought.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to ask Ledwith for an opinion?"
Arthur suggested.</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with it?" Everard snapped, unsoftened
by the mellow atmosphere of the feast.</p>

<p>"It is no longer a practical question with me," Owen
said cheerfully. "I have always said that if the common
people of the British Isles got an understanding of each
other, and a better liking for each other, the end of
oppression would come very soon. They are kept apart
by the artificial hindrances raised by the aristocracy of
birth and money. The common people easily fraternize,
if they are permitted. See them in this country, living,
working, intermarrying, side by side."</p>

<p>"How will that sound among the brethren?" said
Arthur disappointed.</p>

<p>His mother flashed him a look of triumph, and Lord
Constantine looked foolishly happy.</p>

<p>"As the utterance of a maniac, of course. Have they
ever regarded me as sane?" he answered easily.</p>

<p>"And what becomes of your dream?" Arthur persisted.</p>

<p>"I have myself become a dream," he answered sadly.
"I am passing into the land of dreams, of shadows. My
dream was Ireland; a principle that would bring forth its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
own flower, fruit, and seed; not a department of an
empire. Who knows what is best in this world of change?
Some day men may realize the poet's dream:</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 34%;">
<div class="poem">
"The parliament of man, the federation of the world."
</div></div>

<p>Arthur surrendered with bad grace. He had expected
from Ledwith the last, grand, fiery denunciation which
would have swept the room as a broadside sweeps a deck,
and hurled the schemes of his mother and Lord Constantine
into the sea. Sad, sad, to see how champagne can
undo such a patriot! For that matter the golden wine had
undone the entire party. Judy declared to her dying day
that the alliance was toasted amid cheers before the close
of the banquet; that Lord Constantine in his delight
kissed Anne as she left the room; with many other circumstances
too improbable to find a place in a veracious
history. It is a fact, however, that the great scheme
which still agitates the peoples interested, had its success
depended on the guests of Anne Dillon, would have been
adopted that night. The dinner was a real triumph.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, dinners do not make treaties; and, as
Arthur declared, one dinner is good enough until a better
is eaten. When the member of the British Cabinet came
to sit at Anne's table, if one might say so, the tables were
turned. Birmingham instead of Monsignor played the
lead; the man whose practical temperament, financial and
political influence, could soothe and propitiate his own
people and interest the moneyed men in the alliance. It
was admitted no scheme of this kind could progress without
his aid. He had been reserved for the Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>No one thought much about the dinner except the
hostess, who felt, as she looked down the beautiful table,
that her glory had reached its brilliant meridian. A
cabinet minister, a lord, a countess, a leading Knickerbocker,
the head of Tammany, and a few others who did
not matter; what a long distance from the famous cat-show
and Mulberry Street! Arthur also looked up the
table with satisfaction. If his part in the play had not
been dumb show (by his mother's orders), he would have
quoted the famous grind of the mills of the gods. The
two races, so unequally matched at home, here faced each
other on equal ground. Birmingham knew what he had
to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure," he said to the cabinet minister, "that in
a matter so serious you want absolute sincerity?"</p>

<p>"Absolute, and thank you," replied the great man.</p>

<p>"Then let me begin with myself. Personally I would
not lift my littlest finger to help this scheme. I might
not go out of my way to hinder it, but I am that far Irish
in feeling, not to aid England so finely. For a nation
that will soon be without a friend in the world, an alliance
with us would be of immense benefit. No man of Irish
blood, knowing what his race has endured and still endures
from the English, can keep his self-respect and back the
scheme."</p>

<p>Arthur was sorry for his lordship, who sat utterly
astounded and cast down wofully at this expression of
feeling from such a man.</p>

<p>"The main question can be answered in this way,"
Birmingham continued. "Were I willing to take part in
this business, my influence with the Irish and their descendants,
whatever it may be, would not be able to bring
a corporal's guard into line in its behalf."</p>

<p>Lord Constantine opened his mouth, Everard snorted
his contempt, but the great man signaled silence. Birmingham
paid no attention.</p>

<p>"In this country the Irish have learned much more
than saving money and acquiring power; they have
learned the unredeemed blackness of the injustice done
them at home, just as I learned it. What would Grahame
here, Sullivan, Senator Dillon, or myself have been at this
moment had we remained in Ireland? Therefore the
Irish in this country are more bitter against the English
government than their brethren at home. I am certain
that no man can rally even a minority of the Irish to the
support of the alliance. I am sure I could not. I am
certain the formal proposal of the scheme would rouse
them to fiery opposition."</p>

<p>"Remember," Arthur whispered to Everard, raging to
speak, "that the Cabinet Minister doesn't care to hear
anyone but Birmingham."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, Conny," he whispered to his lordship,
"but it's the truth."</p>

<p>"Never enjoyed anything so much," said Grahame <i>sotto
voce</i>, his eyes on Everard.</p>

<p>"However, let us leave the Irish out of the question,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the speaker went on. "Or, better, let us suppose them
favorable, and myself able to win them over. What
chance has the alliance of success? None."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" cried Everard, unabashed by the beautiful
English stare of the C. M.</p>

<p>"The measure is one-sided commercially. This country
has nothing to gain from a scheme, which would be a
mine to England; therefore the moneyed men will not
touch it, will not listen to it. Their time is too valuable.
What remains? An appeal to the people on the score
of humanity, brotherhood, progress, what you please?
My opinion is that the dead weight there could not be
moved. The late war and the English share in it are too
fresh in the public mind. The outlook to me is utterly
against your scheme."</p>

<p>"It might be objected to your view that feeling is too
strong an element of it," said the Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>"Feeling has only to do with my share in the scheme,"
Birmingham replied. "As an Irishman I would not
further it, yet I might be glad to see it succeed. My opinion
is concerned with the actual conditions as I see them."</p>

<p>With this remark the formal discussion ended. Mortified
at this outcome of his plans, Lord Constantine could
not be consoled.</p>

<p>"As long as Livingstone is on your side, Conny," said
Arthur, "you are foredoomed."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," His Lordship answered with some
bitterness. "The Chief Justice of the United States is a
good friend to have."</p>

<p>A thrill shot through Dillon at this emphasis to a
rumor hitherto too light for printing. The present incumbent
of the high office mentioned by Lord Constantine
lay dying. Livingstone coveted few places, and this
would be one. In so exalted a station he would be "enskied
and sainted." Even his proud soul would not disdain
to step from the throne-room of Windsor to the dais
of the Supreme Court of his country. And to strike him
in the very moment of his triumph, to snatch away the
prize, to close his career like a broken sentence with a
dash and a mark of interrogation, to bring him home like
any dead game in a bag: here would be magnificent justice!</p>

<p>"Have I found thee, O mine enemy?" Arthur cried in

<h3 class="chapter2">THE CATHEDRAL.</h3>


<p>Ledwith was dying in profound depression, like most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
brave souls, whose success has been partial, or whose failure
has been absolute. This mournful ending to a brave,
unselfish life seemed to Arthur pitiful and monstrous.
A mere breathing-machine like himself had enjoyed a
stimulating vengeance for the failure of one part of his
life. Oh, how sweet had been that vengeance! The
draught had not yet reached the bottom of the cup! His
cause for the moment a ruin, dragged down with Fenianism;
his great enemy stronger, more glorious, and more
pitiless than when he had first raised his hand against her
injustice; now the night had closed in upon Ledwith,
not merely the bitter night of sickness and death and failure,
but that more savage night of despondency, which
steeps all human sorrow in the black, polluted atmosphere
of hell. For such a sufferer the heart of Arthur Dillon
opened as wide as the gates of heaven. Oh, had he not
known what it is to suffer so, without consolation!</p>

<p>He was like a son to Owen Ledwith.</p>

<p>Every plan born in the poetic and fertile brain of the
patriot he took oath to carry out; he vowed his whole life
to the cause of Ireland; and he consoled Owen for apparent
failure by showing him that he had not altogether
failed, since a man, young, earnest, determined, and
wealthy should take up the great work just where he
dropped it. Could any worker ask more of life? A hero
should go to his eternity with lofty joy, leaving his noble
example to the mean world, a reproach to the despicable
among rulers, a star in the night to the warriors of
justice.</p>

<p>In Honora her father did not find the greatest comfort.
His soul was of the earth and human liberty was his day-star;
her soul rose above that great human good to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
freedom of heaven. Her heart ached for him, that he
should be going out of life with only human consolation.
The father stood in awe of an affection, which at the same
time humbled and exalted him; she had never loved man
or woman like him; he was next to God in that virginal
heart, for with all her love of country, the father had the
stronger hold on her. Too spiritual for him, her sublime
faith did not cheer him. Yet when they looked straight
into each other's eyes with the consciousness of what was
coming, mutual anguish terribly probed their love. He
had no worry for her.</p>

<p>"She has the best of friends," he said to Arthur, "she
is capable, and trained to take care of herself handsomely;
but these things will not be of any use. She will go to
the convent."</p>

<p>"Not if Lord Constantine can hinder it," Arthur said
bluntly.</p>

<p>"I would like to see her in so exalted and happy a sphere
as Lord Constantine could give her. But I am convinced
that the man is not born who can win the love of this
child of mine. Sir Galahad might, but not the stuff of
which you and I are made."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Arthur.</p>

<p>Honora herself told him of her future plans, as they
sat with the sick man after a trying evening, when for
some hours the end seemed near. The hour invited confidences,
and like brother and sister at the sick-bed of a
beloved parent they exchanged them. When she had
finished telling him how she had tried to do her duty to
her father, and to her country, and how she had laid aside
her idea of the convent for their sake, but would now take
up her whole duty to God by entering a sisterhood, he
said casually:</p>

<p>"It seems to me these three duties work together; and
when you were busiest with your father and your country,
then were you most faithful to God."</p>

<p>"Very true," she replied, looking up with surprise.
"Obedience is better than sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Take care that you are not deceiving yourself,
Honora. Which would cause more pain, to give up your
art and your cause, or to give up the convent?"</p>

<p>"To give up the convent," she replied promptly.</p>

<p>"That looks to me like selfishness," he said gently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"There are many nuns in the convents working for the
wretched and helping the poor and praying for the oppressed,
while only a few women are devoted directly to
the cause of freedom. It strikes me that you descend
when you retire from a field of larger scope to one which
narrows your circle and diminishes your opportunities. I
am not criticizing the nun's life, but simply your personal
scheme."</p>

<p>"And you think I descend?" she murmured with a
little gasp of pain. "Why, how can that be?"</p>

<p>"You are giving up the work, the necessary work,
which few women are doing, to take up a work in which
many women are engaged," he answered, uncertain of his
argument, but quite sure of his intention. "You lose
great opportunities to gain small ones, purely personal.
That's the way it looks to me."</p>

<p>With wonderful cunning he unfolded his arguments in
the next few weeks. He appealed to her love for her
father, her wish to see his work continued; he described
his own helplessness, very vaguely though, in carrying out
schemes with which he was unacquainted, and to which he
was vowed; he mourned over the helpless peoples of the
world, for whom a new community was needed to fight,
as the Knights of St. John fought for Christendom; and
he painted with delicate satire that love of ease which
leads heroes to desert the greater work for the lesser on
the plea of the higher life. Selfishly she sought rest,
relief for the taxing labors, anxieties, and journeys of
fifteen years, and not the will of God, as she imagined.
Was he conscious of his own motives? Did he discover
therein any selfishness? Who can say?</p>

<p>He discoursed at the same time to Owen, and in the
same fashion. Ledwith felt that his dreams were patch
work beside the rainbow visions of this California miner,
who had the mines which make the wildest dreams come
true sometimes. The wealthy enthusiast might fall, however,
into the hands of the professional patriot, who would
bleed him to death in behalf of paper schemes. To whom
could he confide him? Honora! It had always been
Honora with him, who could do nothing without her. He
did not wish to hamper her in the last moment, as he had
hampered her since she had first planned her own life.</p>

<p>It was even a pleasant thought for him, to think of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
faithful child living her beautiful, quiet, convent life,
after the fatigues and pilgrimages of years, devoted to his
memory, mingling his name with her prayers, innocent of
any other love than for him and her Creator. Yes, she
must be free as the air after he died. However, the sick
are not masters of their emotions. A great dread and a
great anguish filled him. Would it be his fate to lose
Arthur to Ireland by consideration for others? But he
loved her so! How could he bind her in bonds at the
very moment of their bitter separation? He would not
do it! He would not do it! He fought down his own
longing until he woke up in a sweat of terror one night,
and called to her loudly, fearing that he would die before
he exacted from her the last promise. He must sacrifice
all for his country, even the freedom of his child.</p>

<p>"Honora," he cried, "was I ever faithless to Erin?
Did I ever hesitate when it was a question of money, or
life, or danger, or suffering for her sake?"</p>

<p>"Never, father dear," she said, soothing him like a
child.</p>

<p>"I have sinned now, then. For your sake I have
sinned. I wished to leave you free when I am gone,
although I saw you were still necessary to Eire. Promise
me, my child, that you will delay a little after I am gone,
before entering the convent; that you will make sure
beforehand that Erin has no great need of you ... just
a month or a year ... any delay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As long as you please, father," she said quietly.
"Make it five years if you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," he interrupted with anguish in his throat.
"I shall never demand again from you the sacrifices of the
past. What may seem just to you will be enough. I die
almost happy in leaving Arthur Dillon to carry on with
his talent and his money the schemes of which I only
dreamed. But I fear the money patriots will get hold of
him and cheat him of his enthusiasm and his money
together. If you were by to let him know what was best
to be done&mdash;that is all I ask of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A year at least then, father dear! What is time to
you and me that we should be stingy of the only thing we
ever really possessed."</p>

<p>"And now I lose even that," with a long sigh.</p>

<p>Thus gently and naturally Arthur gained his point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsignor came often, and then oftener when Owen's
strength began to fail rapidly. The two friends in Irish
politics had little agreement, but in the gloom of approaching
death they remembered only their friendship. The
priest worked vainly to put Owen into a proper frame of
mind before his departure for judgment. He had made
his peace with the Church, and received the last rites like
a believer, but with the coldness of him who receives
necessities from one who has wronged him. He was dying,
not like a Christian, but like the pagan patriot who has
failed: only the shades awaited him when he fled from
the darkness of earthly shame. They sat together one
March afternoon facing the window and the declining sun.
To the right another window gave them a good view of
the beautiful cathedral, whose twin spires, many turrets,
and noble walls shone blue and golden in the brilliant
light.</p>

<p>"I love to look at it from this elevation," said Monsignor,
who had just been discoursing on the work of his
life. "In two years, just think, the most beautiful
temple in the western continent will be dedicated."</p>

<p>"The money that has gone into it would have struck
a great blow for Erin," said Ledwith with a bitter sigh.</p>

<p>"So much of it as escaped the yawning pockets of the
numberless patriots," retorted Monsignor dispassionately.
"The money would not have been lost in so good a cause,
but its present use has done more for your people than a
score of the blows which you aim at England."</p>

<p>"Claim everything in sight while you are at it," said
Owen. "In God's name what connection has your gorgeous
cathedral with any one's freedom?"</p>

<p>"Father dear, you are exciting yourself," Honora broke
in, but neither heeded her.</p>

<p>"Christ brought us true freedom," said Monsignor,
"and the Church alone teaches, practises, and maintains
it."</p>

<p>"A fine example is provided by Ireland, where to a dead
certainty freedom was lost because the Church had too
unnatural a hold upon the people."</p>

<p>"What was lost on account of the faith will be given
back again with compound interest. Political and military
movements have done much for Ireland in fifty years;
but the only real triumphs, universal, brilliant, enduring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
significant, leading surely up to greater things, have been
won by the Irish faith, of which that cathedral, shining so
gloriously in the sun this afternoon, is both a result and a
symbol."</p>

<p>"I believe you will die with that conviction," Ledwith
said in wonder.</p>

<p>"I wish you could die with the same, Owen," replied
Monsignor tenderly.</p>

<p>They fell silent for a little under the stress of sudden
feeling.</p>

<p>"How do men reason themselves into such absurdities?"
Owen asked himself.</p>

<p>"You ought to know. You have done it often enough,"
said the priest tartly.</p>

<p>Then both laughed together, as they always did when
the argument became personal.</p>

<p>"Do you know what Livingstone and Bradford and the
people whom they represent think of that temple?" said
Monsignor impressively.</p>

<p>"Oh, their opinions!" Owen snorted.</p>

<p>"They are significant," replied the priest. "These two
leaders would give the price of the building to have kept
down or destroyed the spirit which undertook and carried
out the scheme. They have said to themselves many times
in the last twenty years, while that temple rose slowly but
gloriously into being, what sort of a race is this, so despised
and ill-treated, so poor and ignorant, that in a brief
time on our shores can build the finest temple to God
which this country has yet seen? What will the people,
to whom we have described this race as sunk in papistical
stupidity, debased, unenterprising, think, when they
gaze on this absolute proof of our mendacity?"</p>

<p>Ledwith, in silence, took a second look at the shining
walls and towers.</p>

<p>"Owen, your generous but short-sighted crowd have
fought England briefly and unsuccessfully a few times on
the soil of Ireland ... but the children of the faith have
fought her with church, and school, and catechism around
the globe. Their banner, around which they fought, was
not the banner of the Fenians but the banner of Christ.
What did you do for the scattered children of the household?
Nothing, but collect their moneys. While the
great Church followed them everywhere with her priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
centered them about the temple, and made them the bulwark
of the faith, the advance-guard, in many lands.
Here in America, and in all the colonies of England, in
Scotland, even in England itself, wherever the Irish settled,
the faith took root and flourished; the faith which
means death to the English heresy, and to English power
as far as it rests upon the heresy."</p>

<p>"The faith kept the people together, scattered all over
the world. It organized them, it trained them, it kept
them true to the Christ preached by St. Patrick; it built
the fortress of the temple, and the rampart of the school;
it kept them a people apart, it kept them civilized, saved
them from inevitable apostasy, and founded a force from
which you collect your revenues for battle with your enemies;
a force which fights England all over the earth
night and day, in legislatures, in literature and journalism,
in social and commercial life ... why, man, you
are a fragment, a mere fragment, you and your warriors,
of that great fight which has the world for an audience
and the English earths for its stage."</p>

<p>"When did you evolve this new fallacy?" said Ledwith
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"You have all been affected with the spirit of the anti-Catholic
revolution in Europe, whose cry is that the Church
is the enemy of liberty; yours, that it has been no friend
to Irish liberty. Take another look at that cathedral.
When you are dead, and many others that will live longer,
that church will deliver its message to the people who
pass: 'I am the child of the Catholic faith and the Irish;
the broad shoulders of America waited for a simple, poor,
cast-out people, to dig me from the earth and shape me
into a thing of beauty, a glory of the new continent; I
myself am not new; I am of that race which in Europe
speaks in divine language to you pigmies of the giants that
lived in ancient days; I am a new bond between the old
continent and the new, between the old order and the new;
I speak for the faith of the past; I voice the faith of the
hour; the hands that raised me are not unskilled and
untrained; from what I am judge, ye people, of what
stuff my builders are made.' And around the world, in
all the capitals, in the great cities, of the English-speaking
peoples, temples of lesser worth and beauty, are speaking
in the same strain."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Honora anxiously watched her father. A new light
shone upon him, a new emotion disturbed him; perhaps
that old hardness within was giving way. Ledwith
had the poetic temperament, and the philosopher's
power of generalization. A hint could open a grand horizon
before him, and the cathedral in its solemn beauty
was the hint. Of course, he could see it all, blind as he
had been before. The Irish revolution worked fitfully,
and exploded in a night, its achievement measured by the
period of a month; but this temple and its thousand sisters
lived on doing their good work in silence, fighting for
the truth without noise or conspiracy.</p>

<p>"And this is the glory of the Irish," Monsignor continued,
"this is the fact which fills me with pride, American
as I am, in the race whose blood I own; they have preserved
the faith for the great English-speaking world. Already
the new principle peculiar to that faith has begun its work
in literature, in art, in education, in social life. Heresy
allowed the Christ to be banished from all the departments
of human activity, except the home and the temple.
Christ is not in the schools of the children, nor in the
books we read, nor in the pictures and sculptures of our
studios, nor in our architecture, even of the churches,
nor in our journalism, any more than in the market-place
and in the government. These things are purely pagan,
or worthless composites. It looks as if the historian of
these times, a century or two hence, will have hard work
to fitly describe the Gesta Hibernicorum, when this
principle of Christianity will have conquered the American
world as it conquered ancient Europe. I tell you,
Owen," and he strode to the window with hands outstretched
to the great building, "in spite of all the
shame and suffering endured for His sake, God has been
very good to your people, He is heaping them with honors.
As wide as is the power of England, it is no wider than the
influence of the Irish faith. Stubborn heresy is doomed
to fall before the truth which alone can set men free and
keep them so."</p>

<p>Ledwith had begun to tremble, but he said never a word.</p>

<p>"I am prouder to have had a share in the building of
that temple," Monsignor continued, "than to have won a
campaign against the English. This is a victory, not of
one race over another, but of the faith over heresy, truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
over untruth. It will be the Christ-like glory of Ireland
to give back to England one day the faith which a corrupt
king destroyed, for which we have suffered crucifixion.
No soul ever loses by climbing the cross with Christ."</p>

<p>Ledwith gave a sudden cry, and raised his hands to
heaven, but grew quiet at once.</p>

<p>The priest watched contentedly the spires of his cathedral.</p>

<p>"You have touched heart and reason together," Honora
whispered.</p>

<p>Ledwith remained a long time silent, struggling with a
new spirit. At last he turned the wide, frank eyes on his
friend and victor.</p>

<p>"I am conquered, Monsignor."</p>

<p>"Not wholly yet, Owen."</p>

<p>"I have been a fool, a foolish fool,&mdash;not to have seen
and understood."</p>

<p>"And your folly is not yet dead. You are dying in
sadness and despair almost, when you should go to eternity
in triumph."</p>

<p>"I go in triumph! Alas! if I could only be blotted out
with my last breath, and leave neither grave nor memory,
it would be happiness. Why do you say, 'triumph'?"</p>

<p>"Because you have been true to your country with the
fidelity of a saint. That's enough. Besides you leave
behind you the son born of your fidelity to carry on your
work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God bless that noble son," Owen cried.</p>

<p>"And a daughter whose prayers will mount from the
nun's cell, to bless your cause. If you could but go from
her resigned!"</p>

<p>"How I wish that I might. I ought to be happy, just
for leaving two such heirs, two noble hostages to Ireland.
I see my error. Christ is the King, and no man can
better His plans for men. I surrender to Him."</p>

<p>"But your submission is only in part. You are not
wholly conquered."</p>

<p>"Twice have you said that," Owen complained, raising
his heavy eyes in reproach.</p>

<p>"Love of country is not the greatest love."</p>

<p>"No, love of the race, of humanity, is more."</p>

<p>"And the love of God is more than either. With all
their beauty, what do these abstract loves bring us? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
country we love can give us a grave and a stone. Humanity
crucifies its redeemers. Wolsey summed up the
matter: 'Had I but served my God with half the zeal with
which I served my king, He would not in mine age, have
left me naked to mine enemies.'"</p>

<p>He paused to let his words sink into Ledwith's mind.</p>

<p>"Owen, you are leaving the world oppressed by the
hate of a lifetime, the hate ingrained in your nature, the
fatal gift of persecutor and persecuted from the past."</p>

<p>"And I shall never give that up," Owen declared,
sitting up and fixing his hardest look on the priest. "I
shall never forget Erin's wrongs, nor Albion's crimes. I
shall carry that just and honorable hate beyond the grave.
Oh, you priests!"</p>

<p>"I said you were not conquered. You may hate injustice,
but not the unjust. You will find no hate in
heaven, only justice. The persecutors and their victims
have long been dead, and judged. The welcome of the
wretched into heaven, the home of justice and love, wiped
out all memory of suffering here, as it will for us all. The
justice measured out to their tyrants even you would be
satisfied with. Can your hate add anything to the joy of
the blessed, or the woe of the lost?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," murmured Owen from the pillow, as his
eyes looked afar, wondering at that justice so soon to be
measured out to him. "You are again right. Oh, but
we are feeble ... but we are foolish ... to think it.
What is our hate any more than our justice ... both
impotent and ridiculous."</p>

<p>There followed a long pause, then, for Monsignor had
finished his argument, and only waited to control his own
emotion before saying good-by.</p>

<p>"I die content," said Ledwith with a long restful sigh,
coming back to earth, after a deep look into divine power
and human littleness. "Bring me to-morrow, and often,
the Lord of Justice. I never knew till now that in desiring
Justice so ardently, it was He I desired. Monsignor,
I die content, without hate, and without despair."</p>

<p>If ever a human creature had a foretaste of heaven it
was Honora during the few weeks that followed this happy
day. The bitterness in the soul of Owen vanished like a
dream, and with it went regret, and vain longing, and the
madness which at odd moments sprang from these emo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>tions.
His martyrdom, so long and ferocious, would end
in the glory of a beautiful sunset, the light of heaven in
his heart, shining in his face. He lay forever beyond the
fire of time and injustice.</p>

<p>Every morning Honora prepared the little altar in the
sick-room, and Monsignor brought the Blessed Sacrament.
Arthur answered the prayers and gazed with awe upon the
glorified face of the father, with something like anger upon
the exalted face of the daughter; for the two were gone
suddenly beyond him. Every day certain books provided
by Monsignor were read to the dying man by the daughter
or the son; describing the migration of the Irish all over
the English-speaking world, their growth to consequence
and power. Owen had to hear the figures of this growth,
see and touch the journals printed by the scattered race,
and to hear the editorials which spoke their success, their
assurance, their convictions, their pride.</p>

<p>Then he laughed so sweetly, so naturally, chuckled so
mirthfully that Honora had to weep and thank God for
this holy mirthfulness, which sounded like the spontaneous,
careless, healthy mirth of a boy. Monsignor came
evenings to explain, interpret, put flesh and life into the
reading of the day with his vivid and pointed comment.
Ledwith walked in wonderland. "The hand of God is
surely there," was his one saying. The last day of his
pilgrimage he had a long private talk with Arthur. They
had indeed become father and son, and their mutual tenderness
was deep.</p>

<p>Honora knew from the expression of the two men that
a new element had entered into her father's happiness.</p>

<p>"I free you from your promise, my child," said Ledwith,
"my most faithful, most tender child. It is the
glory of men that the race is never without such children
as you. You are free from any bond. It is my wish that
you accept your release."</p>

<p>She accepted smiling, to save him from the stress of
emotion. Then he wished to see the cathedral in the light
of the afternoon sun, and Arthur opened the door of the
sick-room. The dying man could see from his pillow the
golden spires, and the shining roof, that spoke to him so
wonderfully of the triumph of his race in a new land, the
triumph which had been built up in the night, unseen,
uncared for, unnoticed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"God alone has the future," he said.</p>

<p>Once he looked at Honora, once more, with burning
eyes, that never could look enough on that loved child.
With his eyes on the great temple, smiling, he died.
They thought he had fallen asleep in his weakness. Honora
took his head in her arms, and Arthur Dillon stood
beside her and wept.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE FALL OF LIVINGSTONE.</h3>


<p>The ending of Quincy Livingstone's career in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
promised to be like the setting of the sun: his glory
fading on the hills of Albion only to burn with greater
splendor in his native land: Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court! He needed the elevation. True, his career at
court had been delightful, from the English point of view
even brilliant; the nobility had made much of him, if not
as much as he had made of the nobility; the members of
the government had seriously praised him, far as they stood
from Lord Constantine's theory of American friendship.
However pleasant these things looked to the Minister, of
what account could they be to a mere citizen returning
to private life in New York? Could they make up for the
failures of the past year at home, the utter destruction of
his pet schemes for the restraint of the Irish in the land
of the Puritans?</p>

<p>What disasters! The alliance thrust out of consideration
by the strong hand of Birmingham; the learned
Fritters chased from the platform by cold audiences, and
then from the country by relentless ridicule; Sister Claire
reduced to the rank of a tolerated criminal, a ticket-of-leave
girl; and the whole movement discredited! Fortunately
these calamities remained unknown in London.</p>

<p>The new honors, however, would hide the failure and
the shame. His elevation was certain. The President
had made known his intention, and had asked Minister
Livingstone to be ready within a short time to sail for
home for final consultation. His departure from the
court of St. James would be glorious, and his welcome
home significant; afterwards his place would be amongst
the stars. He owned the honorable pride that loves power
and place, when these are worthy, but does not seek them.
From the beginning the Livingstones had no need to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
after office. It always sought them, receiving as rich a
lustre as it gave in the recognition of their worth. His
heart grew warm that fortune had singled him out for
the loftiest place in his country's gift. To die chief-justice
atoned for life's shortcomings. Life itself was at
once steeped in the color and perfume of the rose.</p>

<p>Felicitations poured in from the great. The simplicities
of life suddenly put on a new charm, the commonplaces
a new emphasis. My Lord Tomnoddy's 'how-de-do'
was uttered with feeling, men took a second look at
him, the friends of a season felt a warmth about their
language, if not about the heart, in telling of his coming
dignity. The government people shook off their natural
drowsiness to measure the facts, to understand that emotion
should have a share in uttering the words of farewell.
"Oh, my <i>dear</i>, <span class="smcap">DEAR</span> Livingstone!" cried the
Premier as he pressed his hand vigorously at their first
meeting after the news had been given out. Society sang
after the same fashion. Who could resist the delight of
these things?</p>

<p>His family and friends exulted. Lovable and deep-hearted
with them, harsh as he might be with opponents,
their gladness gave him joy. The news spread among the
inner circles with due reserve, since no one forgot the distance
between the cup and the lip; but to intimates the
appointment was said to be a certainty, and confirmation by
the Senate as sure as anything mortal. Of course the Irish
would raise a clamor, but no arm among them had length
or strength enough to snatch away the prize. Not in many
years had Livingstone dipped so deeply into the waters of
joy as in the weeks that followed the advice from the President.</p>

<p>Arthur Dillon knew that mere opposition would not
affect Livingstone's chances. His position was too strong
to be stormed, he learned upon inquiry in Washington.
The political world was quiet to drowsiness, and the
President so determined in his choice that candidates
would not come forward to embarrass his nominee. The
public accepted the rumor of the appointment with indifference,
which remained undisturbed when a second
rumor told of Irish opposition. But for Arthur's determination
the selection of a chief-justice would have been
as dull as the naming of a consul to Algiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can make a good fight," was Grahame's conclusion,
"but the field belongs to Livingstone."</p>

<p>"Chance is always kind to the unfit," said Arthur,
"because the Irish are good-natured."</p>

<p>"I don't see the connection."</p>

<p>"I should have said, because mankind is so. In this
case Quincy gets the prize, because the Irish think he will
get it."</p>

<p>"You speak like the oracle," said Grahame.</p>

<p>"Well, the fight must be made, a stiff one, to the last
cartridge. But it won't be enough, mere opposition.
There must be another candidate. We can take Quincy
in front; the candidate can take him in the rear. It
must not be seen, only said, that the President surrendered
to Irish pressure. There's the plan: well-managed opposition,
and another candidate. We can see to the first,
who will be the other?"</p>

<p>They were discussing that point without fruit when
Anne knocked at the door of the study, and entered in
some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Is it true, what I heard whispered," said she, "that
they will soon be looking for a minister to England, that
Livingstone is coming back?"</p>

<p>"True, mother dear," and he rose to seat her comfortably.
"But if you can find us a chief-justice the good
man will not need to come back. He can remain to help
keep patriots in English prisons."</p>

<p>"Why I want to make sure, you know, is that Vandervelt
should get the English mission this time without fail.
I wouldn't have him miss it for the whole world."</p>

<p>"There's your man," said Grahame.</p>

<p>"Better than the English mission, mother," Arthur
said quickly, "would be the chief-justiceship for so good
a man as Vandervelt. If you can get him to tell his
friends he wants to be chief-justice, I can swear that he
will get one place or the other. I know which one he
would prefer. No, not the mission. That's for a few
years, forgotten honors. The other's for life, lasting
honor. Oh, how Vandervelt must sigh for that noble
dais, the only throne in the Republic, the throne of American
justice. Think, how Livingstone would defile it!
The hater and persecutor of a wronged and hounded race,
who begrudges us all but the honors of slavery, how could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he understand and administer justice, even among his
own?"</p>

<p>"What are you raving about, Artie?" she complained.
"I'll get Vandervelt to do anything if it's the right thing
for him to do; only explain to me what you want done."</p>

<p>He explained so clearly that she was filled with delight.
With a quickness which astonished him, she picked up
the threads of the intrigue; some had their beginning
five years back, and she had not forgotten. Suddenly
the root of the affair bared itself to her: this son of hers
was doing battle for his own. She had forgotten Livingstone
long ago, and therefore had forgiven him. Arthur
had remembered. Her fine spirit stirred dubious Grahame.</p>

<p>"Lave Vandervelt to me," she said, for her brogue
came back and gently tripped her at times, "and do you
young men look after Livingstone. I have no hard feelings
against him, but, God forgive me, when I think of
Louis Everard, and all that Mary suffered, and Honora,
and the shame put upon us by Sister Claire, something
like hate burns me. Anyway we're not worth bein'
tramped upon, if we let the like of him get so high, when
we can hinder it."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Irish!" cried Grahame, and the two
cheered her as she left the room to prepare for her share
of the labor.</p>

<p>The weight of the work lay in the swift and easy formation
of an opposition whose strength and temper would
be concealed except from the President, and whose action
would be impressive, consistent, and dramatic. The press
was to know only what it wished to know, without provocation.
The main effort should convince the President of
the unfitness of one candidate and the fitness of the
other. There were to be no public meetings or loud denunciations.
What cared the officials for mere cries of
rage? Arthur found his task delightful, and he worked
like a smith at the forge, heating, hammering, and shaping
his engine of war. When ready for action, his mother
had won Vandervelt, convinced him that his bid for the
greater office would inevitably land him in either place.
He had faith in her, and she had prophesied his future
glory!</p>

<p>Languidly the journals gave out in due time the advent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of another candidate for the chief-justiceship, and also
cloudy reports of Irish opposition to Livingstone. No
one was interested but John Everard, still faithful to the
Livingstone interest in spite of the gibes of Dillon and
Grahame. The scheme worked so effectively that Arthur
did not care to have any interruptions from this source.
The leaders talked to the President singly, in the order of
their importance, against his nominee, on the score of
party peace. What need to disturb the Irish by naming
a man who had always irritated and even insulted them?
The representation in the House would surely suffer by
his action, because in this way only could the offended
people retaliate. They detested Livingstone.</p>

<p>Day after day this testimony fairly rained upon the President,
unanimous, consistent, and increasing in dignity with
time, each protester seeming more important than he who
just went out the door. Inquiries among the indifferent
proved that the Irish would give much to see Livingstone
lose the honors. And always in the foreground of the
picture of protest stood the popular and dignified Vandervelt
surrounded by admiring friends!</p>

<p>Everard had the knack of ferreting out obscure movements.
When this intrigue was laid bare he found Arthur
Dillon at his throat on the morning he had chosen for a
visit to the President. To promise the executive support
from a strong Irish group in the appointment of Livingstone
would have been fatal to the opposition. Hence
the look which Arthur bestowed on Everard was as ugly
as his determination to put the marplot in a retreat for
the insane, if no other plan kept him at home.</p>

<p>"I want to defeat Livingstone," said Arthur, "and I
think I have him defeated. You had better stay at home.
You are hurting a good cause."</p>

<p>"I am going to destroy that good cause," John boasted
gayly. "You thought you had the field to yourself. And
you had, only that I discovered your game."</p>

<p>"It's a thing to be proud of," Arthur replied sadly,
"this steady support of the man who would have ruined
your boy. Keep quiet. You've got to have the truth
rammed down your throat, since you will take it in no
other way. This Livingstone has been plotting against
your race for twenty years. It may not matter to a disposition
as crooked as yours, that he opened the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
English government people to the meaning of Irish advance
in America, that he is responsible for Fritters, for
the alliance, for McMeeter, for the escaped nun, for her
vile <i>Confessions</i>, for the kidnapping societies here. You
are cantankerous enough to forget that he used his position
in London to do us harm, and you won't see that he will
do as much with the justiceship. Let these things pass.
If you were a good Catholic one might excuse your devotion
to Livingstone on the score that you were eager to return
good for evil. But you're a half-cooked Catholic, John.
Let that pass too. Have you no manhood left in you?
Are you short on self-respect? This man brought out and
backed the woman who sought to ruin your son, to break
your wife's heart, to destroy your own happiness. With
his permission she slandered the poor nuns with tongue
and pen, a vile woman hired to defile the innocent. And
for this man you throw dirt on your own, for this man you
are going to fight your own that he may get honors which
he will shame. Isn't it fair to think that you are going
mad, Everard?"</p>

<p>"Don't attempt," said the other in a fury, "to work off
your oratory on me. I am going to Washington to expose
your intrigues against a gentleman. What! am I to
tremble at your frown&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Rot, man! Who asked you to tremble? I saved your
boy from Livingstone, and I shall save you from yourself,
even if I have to put you in an asylum for the harmless insane.
Don't you believe that Livingstone is the patron of
Sister Claire? that he is indirectly responsible for that
scandal?"</p>

<p>"I never did, and I never shall," with vehemence.
"You are one of those that can prove anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you were sure of his responsibility, would you go to
Washington?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I the evidence of my own senses? Were not
all Livingstone's friends on the committee which exposed
Sister Claire?"</p>

<p>"Because we insisted on that or a public trial, and they
came with sour stomachs," said Arthur, glad that he had
begun to discuss the point. "Would you go to Washington
if you were sure he backed the woman?"</p>

<p>"Enough, young man. I'm off for the train. Here,
Mary, my satchel&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Two strong bands were laid on his shoulders, he was
pushed back into his chair, and the face which glowered
on him after this astonishing violence for the moment
stilled his rage and astonishment.</p>

<p>"Would you go to Washington if you were sure Livingstone
backed Sister Claire?" came the relentless question.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," he answered vacantly.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to be made sure of it?"</p>

<p>He began to turn purple and to bluster.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said his master, "not a cry. Just answer
that question. Do you wish to be made sure of this
man's atrocious guilt and your own folly?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what is the meaning of this," Everard
sputtered, "this violence? In my own house, in broad
day, like a burglar."</p>

<p>"Answer the question."</p>

<p>Alarm began to steal over Everard, who was by no means
a brave man. Had Arthur Dillon, always a strange fellow,
gone mad? Or was this scene a hint of murder? The
desperate societies to which Dillon was said to belong often
indulged in violence. It had never occurred to him before
that these secret forces must be fighting Livingstone
through Dillon. They would never permit him to use his
influence at Washington in the Minister's behalf. Dreadful!
He must dissemble.</p>

<p>"If you can make me sure, I am willing," he said
meekly.</p>

<p>"Read that, then," and Arthur placed his winning card,
as he thought, in his hands; the private confession of
Sister Claire as to the persons who had assisted her in her
outrageous schemes; and the chief, of course, was Livingstone.
Everard read it with contempt.</p>

<p>"Legally you know what her testimony is worth," said
he.</p>

<p>"You accepted her testimony as to her own frauds, and
so did the whole committee."</p>

<p>"We had to accept the evidence of our own senses."</p>

<p>Obstinate to the last was Everard.</p>

<p>"You will not be convinced," said Arthur rudely, "but
you can be muzzled. I say again: keep away from Washington,
and keep your hands off my enterprise. You have
some idea of what happens to men like you for interfering.
If I meet you in Washington, or find any trace of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
meddling in the matter, here is what I shall do; this
whole scandal of the escaped nun shall be reopened, this
confession shall be printed, and the story of Louis' adventure,
from that notable afternoon at four o'clock until his
return, word for word, with portraits of his interesting
family, of Sister Claire, all the details, will be given to
the journals. Do you understand? Meanwhile, study
this problem in psychology: how long will John Everard
be able to endure life after I tell the Irish how he helped
to enthrone their bitterest enemy?"</p>

<p>He did not wait for an answer, but left the baffled man
to wrestle with the situation, which must have worsted
him, for his hand did not appear in the game at Washington.
Very smoothly the plans of Arthur worked to their
climax. The friends of Vandervelt pressed his cause as
urgently and politely as might be, and with increasing energy
as the embarrassment of the President grew. The
inherent weakness of Vandervelt's case appeared to the
tireless Dillon more appalling in the last moments than at
the beginning: the situation had no logical outcome. It
was merely a question whether the President would risk a
passing unpopularity.</p>

<p>He felt the absence of Birmingham keenly, the one
man who could say to the executive with authority, this
appointment would be a blunder. Birmingham being
somewhere on the continent, out of reach of appeals for
help, his place was honorably filled by the General of the
Army, with an influence, however, purely sentimental.
Arthur accompanied him for the last interview with the
President. Only two days intervened before the invitation
would be sent to Livingstone to return home. The great
man listened with sympathy to the head of the army making
his protest, but would promise nothing; he had fixed an
hour however for the settlement of the irritating problem;
if they would call the next morning at ten, he would give
them his unalterable decision.</p>

<p>Feeling that the decision must be against his hopes,
Arthur passed a miserable night prowling with Grahame
about the hotel. Had he omitted any point in the fight?
Was there any straw afloat which could be of service?
Doyle used his gift of poetry to picture for him the return
of Livingstone, and his induction into office; the serenity
of mind, the sense of virtue and patriotism rewarded, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
cold contempt of the defeated opposition and their candidate,
the matchless dignity, which would exalt Livingstone
to the skies as the Chief-Justice. Their only consolation
was the fight itself, which had shaken for a moment
the edifice of the Minister's fame.</p>

<p>The details went to London from friends close to the
President, and enabled Livingstone to measure the full
strength of a young man's hatred. The young man should
be attended to after the struggle. There was no reason
to lose confidence. While the factions were still worrying,
the cablegram came with the request that he sail on
Saturday for home, the equivalent of appointment. When
reading it at the Savage Club, whither a special messenger
had followed him, the heavy mustache and very round
spectacles of Birmingham rose up suddenly before him,
and they exchanged greetings with the heartiness of exiles
from the same land. The Minister remembered that his
former rival had no share in the attempt to deprive him
of his coming honors, and Birmingham recalled the rumor
picked up that day in the city.</p>

<p>"I suppose there's no truth in it," he said.</p>

<p>The Minister handed him the cablegram.</p>

<p>"Within ten days," making a mental calculation, "I
should be on my way back to London, with the confirmation
of the Senate practically secured."</p>

<p>"When it comes I shall be pleased to offer my congratulations,"
Birmingham replied, and the remark
slightly irritated Livingstone.</p>

<p>Could he have seen what happened during the next few
hours his sleep would have lost its sweetness. Birmingham
went straight to the telegraph office, and sent a cipher
despatch to his man of business, ordering him to see the
President that night in Washington, and to declare in his
name, with all the earnestness demanded by the situation,
that the appointment of Livingstone would mean political
death to him and immense embarrassment to his party for
years. As it would be three in the morning before a reply
would reach London, Birmingham went to bed with a good
conscience. Thus, while the two young men babbled all
night in the hotel, and thought with dread of the fatal
hour next morning, wire, and train, and business man
flew into the capital and out of it, carrying one man's word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in and another man's glory out, fleet, silent, unrecognized,
unhonored, and unknown.</p>

<p>At breakfast Birmingham read the reply from his
business man with profound satisfaction. At breakfast
the Minister read a second cablegram with a sudden
recollection of Birmingham's ominous words the night
before. He knew that he would need no congratulations,
for the prize had been snatched away forever. The cablegram
informed him that he should not sail on Saturday,
and that explanations would follow. For a moment his
proud heart failed him. Bitterness flowed in on him, so
that the food in his mouth became tasteless. What did
he care that his enemies had triumphed? Or, that he had
been overthrown? The loss of the vision which had
crowned his life, and made a hard struggle for what he
thought the fit and right less sordid, even beautiful; that
was a calamity.</p>

<p>He had indulged it in spite of mental protests against
the dangerous folly. The swift imagination, prompted
by all that was Livingstone in him, had gone over the
many glories of the expected dignity; the departure from
beautiful and flattering England, the distinction of the
return to his beloved native land, the splendid interval
before the glorious day, the crowning honors amid the
applause of his own, and the long sweet afternoon of life,
when each day would bring its own distinction! He had
had his glimpse of Paradise. Oh, never, never would life be
the same for him! He began to study the reasons for his
ill-success....</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that day the President informed the
General of the Army in Mr. Dillon's presence that he had
sent the name of Hon. Van Rensselaer Vandervelt to the
Senate for the position of Chief-Justice!</p>

<p>After patient study of the disappearance of Horace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Endicott, for five years, Richard Curran decided to give
up the problem. All clues had come to nothing. Not
the faintest trace of the missing man had been found.
His experience knew nothing like it. The money earned
in the pursuit would never repay him for the loss of self-confidence
and of nerve, due to study and to ill success.
But for his wife he would have withdrawn long ago from
the search.</p>

<p>"Since you have failed," she said, "take up my theory.
You will find that man in Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>"That's the strongest reason for giving up," he replied.
"Once before I felt my mind going from insane eagerness
to solve the problem. It would not do to have us both in
the asylum at once."</p>

<p>"I made more money in following my instincts, Dick,
than you have made in chasing your theories. Instinct
warned me years ago that Arthur Dillon is another than
what he pretends. It warns me now that he is Horace
Endicott. At least before you give up for good, have a
shy at my theory."</p>

<p>"Instinct! Theory! It is pure hatred. And the hate
of a woman can make her take an ass for Apollo."</p>

<p>"No doubt I hate him. Oh, how I hate that man ...
and young Everard...."</p>

<p>"Or any man that escapes you," he filled in with sly
malice.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Dick," she screamed at him, and he
apologized. "That hate is more to me than my child.
It will grow big enough to kill him yet. But apart from
hate, Arthur Dillon is not the man he seems. I could
swear he is Horace Endicott. Remember all I have told
you about his return. He came back from California about
the time Endicott disappeared. I was playing Edith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Conyngham then with great success, though not to
crowded houses."</p>

<p>She laughed heartily at the recollection.</p>

<p>"I remarked to myself even then that Anne Dillon ...
she's the choice hypocrite ... did not seem easy in
showing the letter which told of his coming back, how
sorry he was for his conduct, how happy he would make
her with the fortune he had earned."</p>

<p>"All pure inference," said Curran. "Twenty men
arrived home in New York about the same time with
fortunes from the mines, and some without fortunes from
the war."</p>

<p>"Then how do you account for this, smart one? Never
a word of his life in California from that day to this.
Mind that. No one knows, or seems to know, just where
he had been, just how he got his money ... you understand
... all the little bits o' things that are told, and
guessed, and leak out in a year. I asked fifty people,
I suppose, and all they knew was: California. You'd
think Judy Haskell knew, and she told me everything.
What had she to tell? that no one dared to ask him about
such matters."</p>

<p>"Dillon is a very close man."</p>

<p>"Endicott had to be among that long-tongued Irish
crowd. I watched him. He was stupid at first ... stuck
to the house ... no one saw him for weeks ... except
the few. He listened and watched ... I saw him ...
his eyes and his ears ought to be as big as a donkey's from
it ... and he said nothing. They made excuses for
a thing that everyone saw and talked about. He was ill.
I say he wanted to make no mistakes; he was learning his
part; there was nothing of the Irish in him, only the sharp
Yankee. It made me wonder for weeks what was wrong.
He looked as much like the boy that ran away as you do.
And then I had no suspicions, mind you. I believed Anne
Dillon's boy had come back with a fortune, and I was
thinking how I could get a good slice of it."</p>

<p>"And you didn't get a cent," Curran remarked.</p>

<p>"He hated me from the beginning. It takes one that
is playing a part to catch another in the same business.
After a while he began to bloom. He got more Irish
than the Irish. There's no Yankee living, no Englishman,
can play the Irishman. He can give a good imita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>tion
maybe, d'ye hear? That's what Dillon gave. He did
everything that young Dillon used to do before he left
home ... a scamp he was too. He danced jigs, flattered
the girls, chummed with the ditch-diggers and barkeepers
... and he hated them all, women and men.
The Yankees hate the Irish as easy as they breathe. I tell
you he had forgotten nothing that he used to do as a boy.
And the fools that looked on said, oh, it's easy to see he
was sick, for now that he is well we can all recognize our
old dare-devil, Arthur."</p>

<p>"He's dare-devil clear enough," commented her husband.</p>

<p>"First point you've scored," she said with contempt.
"Horace Endicott was a milksop: to run away when he
should have killed the two idiots. Dillon is a devil, as I
ought to know. But the funniest thing was his dealings
with his mother. She was afraid of him ... as much as
I am ... she is till this minute. Haven't I seen her
look at him, when she dared to say a sharp thing? And
she's a good actress, mind you. It took her years to act
as a mother can act with a son."</p>

<p>"Quite natural, I think. He went away a boy, came
back a rich man, and was able to boss things, having the
cash."</p>

<p>"You think! You! I've seen ten years of your thinking!
Well, I thought too. I saw a chance for cash, where I
smelled a mystery. Do you know that he isn't a Catholic?
Do you know that he's strange to all Catholic ways? that
he doesn't know how to hear Mass, to kneel when he enters
a pew, to bless himself when he takes the holy water at
the door? Do you know that he never goes to communion?
And therefore he never goes to confession. Didn't I
watch for years, so that I might find out what was wrong
with him, and make some money?"</p>

<p>"All that's very plausible," said her husband. "Only,
there are many Catholics in this town, and in particular
the Californians, that forgot as much as he forgot about
their religion, and more."</p>

<p>"But he is not a Catholic," she persisted. "There's an
understanding between him and Monsignor O'Donnell.
They exchange looks when they meet. He visits the priest
when he feels like it, but in public they keep apart. Oh,
all round, that Arthur Dillon is the strangest fellow; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
he plays his part so well that fools like you, Dick, are
tricked."</p>

<p>"You put a case well, Dearie. But it doesn't convince
me. However," for he knew her whim must be obeyed,
"I don't mind trying again to find Horace Endicott in
this Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>"And of course," with a sneer, "you'll begin with the
certainty that there's nothing in the theory. What can
the cleverest man discover, when he's sure beforehand that
there's nothing to discover?"</p>

<p>"My word, Colette, if I take up the matter, I'll convince
you that you're wrong, or myself that you're right.
And I'll begin right here this minute. I believe with you
that we have found Endicott at last. Then the first question
I ask myself is: who helped Horace Endicott to become
Arthur Dillon?"</p>

<p>"Monsignor O'Donnell of course," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then Endicott must have known the priest before he
disappeared: known him so as to trust him, and to get a
great favor from him? Now, Sonia didn't know that
fact."</p>

<p>"That fool of a woman knows nothing, never did, never
will," she snapped.</p>

<p>"Well, for the sake of peace let us say he was helped
by Monsignor, and knew the priest a little before he went
away. Monsignor helped him to find his present hiding-place;
quite naturally he knew Mrs. Dillon, how her son
had gone and never been heard of: and he knew it would
be a great thing for her to have a son with an income like
Endicott's. The next question is: how many people know
at this moment who Dillon really is?"</p>

<p>"Just two, sir. He's a fox ... they're three foxes
... Monsignor, Anne Dillon, and Arthur himself. I
know, for I watched 'em all, his uncle, his friends, his old
chums ... the fellows he played with before he ran
away ... and no one knows but the two that had to
know ... sly Anne and smooth Monsignor. They made
the money that I wasn't smart enough to get hold
of."</p>

<p>"Then the next question is: is it worth while to make
inquiries among the Irish, his friends and neighbors, the
people that knew the real Dillon?"</p>

<p>"You won't find out any more than I've told you, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
you may prove how little reason they have for accepting
him as the boy that ran away."</p>

<p>"After that it would be necessary to search California."</p>

<p>"Poor Dick," she interrupted with compassion, smoothing
his beard. "You are really losing your old cleverness.
Search California! Can't you see yet the wonderful
'cuteness of this man, Endicott? He settled all that before
he wrote the letter to Anne Dillon, saying that her
son was coming home. He found out the career of Arthur
Dillon in California. If he found that runaway he sent
him off to Australia with a lump of money, to keep out of
sight for twenty years. Did the scamp need much persuading?
I reckon not. He had been doing it for nothing
ten years. Or, perhaps the boy was dead: then he
had only to make the proper connections with his history
up to the time of his death. Or he may have disappeared
forever, and that made the matter all the simpler for Endicott.
Oh, you're not clever, Dick," and she kissed him
to sweeten the bitterness of the opinion.</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced," he said cheerfully. "Then tell
me what to do."</p>

<p>"I don't know myself. Endicott took his money with
him. Where does Arthur Dillon keep his money? How
did it get there? Where was it kept before that? How
is he spending it just now? Does he talk in his sleep?
Are there any mementoes of his past in his private boxes?
Could he be surprised into admissions of his real character
by some trick, such as bringing him face to face on a sudden
with Sonia? Wouldn't that be worth seeing? Just
like the end of a drama. You know the marks on
Endicott's body, birthmarks and the like ... are they
on Dillon's body? The boy that ran away must have had
some marks.... Judy Haskell would know ... are
they on Endicott's body?"</p>

<p>"You've got the map of the business in that pretty head
perfect," said Curran in mock admiration. "But don't
you see, my pet, that if this man is as clever as you would
have him he has already seen to these things? He has
removed the birthmarks and peculiarities of Horace, and
adopted those of Arthur? You'll find it a tangled business
the deeper you dive into it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's your business to dive deeper than the tangle,"
she answered crossly. "If I had your practice&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would leave me miles behind, of course. Here's
the way I would reason about this thing: Horace Endicott
is now known as Arthur Dillon; he has left no track
by which Endicott can be traced to his present locality;
but there must be a very poor connection between the
Dillon at home and the real Dillon in California, in Australia,
or in his grave; if we can trace the real Arthur
Dillon then we take away the foundations of his counterfeit.
Do you see? I say a trip to California and a clean
examination there, after we have done our best here to
pick flaws in the position of the gentleman who has been
so cruel to my pet. He must get his punishment for that,
I swear."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the rub," she whimpered in her childish
way. "I hate him, and I love him. He's the finest fellow
in the world. He has the strength of ten. See how
he fought the battles of the Irish against his own. One
minute I could tear him like a wolf, and now I could let
him tear me to pieces. You are fond of him too, Dick."</p>

<p>"I would follow him to the end of the world, through
fire and flood and fighting," said the detective with feeling.
"He loves Ireland, he loves and pities our poor
people, he is spending his money for them. But I could
kill him just the same for his cruelty to you. He's a hard
man, Colette."</p>

<p>"Now I know what you are trying to do," she said
sharply. "You think you can frighten me by telling me
what I know already. Well, you can't."</p>

<p>"No, no," he protested, "I was thinking of another
thing. We'll come to the danger part later. There is one
test of this man that ought to be tried before all others.
When I have sounded the people about Arthur Dillon, and
am ready for California, Sonia Endicott should be brought
here to have a good look at him in secret first; and then,
perhaps, in the open, if you thought well of it."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I think well of it? But will it do any
good, and mayn't it do harm? Sonia has no brains. If
you can't see any resemblance between Arthur and the
pictures of Horace Endicott, what can Sonia see?"</p>

<p>"The eyes of hate, and the eyes of love," said he
sagely.</p>

<p>"Then I'd be afraid to bring them together," she admitted
whispering again, and cowering into his arms. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
he suspects I am hunting him down, he will have no
pity."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," he said thoughtfully. "I have
always felt the devil in him. Endicott was a fat, gay,
lazy sport, that never so much as rode after the hounds.
Now Arthur Dillon has had his training in the mines.
That explains his dare-devil nature."</p>

<p>"And Horace Endicott was betrayed by the woman he
loved," she cried with sudden fierceness. "That turns a
man sour quicker than all the mining-camps in the world.
That made him lean and terrible like a wolf. That
sharpened his teeth, and gave him a taste for woman's
blood. That's why he hates me."</p>

<p>"You're wrong again, my pet. He has a liking for
you, but you spoil it by laying hands on his own. You
saw his looks when he was hunting for young Everard."</p>

<p>"Oh, how he frightens me," and she began to walk the
room in a rage. "How I would like to throw off this fear
and face him and fight him, as I face you. I'll do it if
the terror kills me. I shall not be terrified by any man.
You shall hunt him down, Dick Curran. Begin at once.
When you are ready send for Sonia. I'll bring them together
myself, and take the responsibility. What can he
do but kill me?"</p>

<p>Sadness came over the detective as she returned to her
seat on his knee.</p>

<p>"He is not the kind, little girl," said he, "that lays
hands on a woman or a man outside of fair, free, open
fight before the whole world."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" knowing very well what he
meant.</p>

<p>"If he found you on his trail," with cunning deliberation,
so that every word beat heart and brain like a hammer,
"and if he is really Horace Endicott, he would only
have to give your character and your address&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To the dogs," she shrieked in a sudden access of horror.</p>

<p>Then she lay very still in his arms, and the man
laughed quietly to himself, sure that he had subdued her
and driven her crazy scheme into limbo. The wild creature
had one dread and by reason of it one master. Never
had she been so amenable to discipline as under Dillon's
remote and affable authority. Curran had no fear of consequences
in studying the secret years of Arthur Dillon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
existence. The study might reveal things which a young
man preferred to leave in the shadows, but would not
deliver up to Sonia her lost Horace; and even if Arthur
came to know what they were doing, he could smile at
Edith's vagaries.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" he ventured to say at last.</p>

<p>"Find Horace Endicott in Arthur Dillon," was the unexpected
answer, energetic, but sighed rather than spoken.
"I fear him, I love him, I hate him, and I'm going to
destroy him before he destroys me. Begin to-night."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A FIRST TEST.</h3>


<p>Curran could not study the Endicott problem. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
mind had lost edge in the vain process, getting as confused
over details as the experimenter in perpetual motion after
an hundred failures. In favor of Edith he said to himself
that her instincts had always been remarkable, always
helpful; and her theory compared well with the twenty
upon which he had worked years to no purpose. Since he
could not think the matter out, he went straight on in
the fashion which fancy had suggested. Taking it for
granted that Dillon and Endicott were the same man,
he must establish the connection; that is, discover the
moment when Horace Endicott passed from his own into
the character of Arthur Dillon.</p>

<p>Two persons would know the fact: Anne Dillon and
her son. Four others might have knowledge of it; Judy,
the Senator, Louis, and Monsignor. A fifth might be
added, if the real Arthur Dillon were still living in obscurity,
held there by the price paid him for following his
own whim. Others would hardly be in the secret. The
theory was charming in itself, and only a woman like
Edith, whose fancy had always been sportive, would have
dreamed it. The detective recalled Arthur's interest in
his pursuit of Endicott; then the little scenes on board
the <i>Arrow</i>; and grew dizzy to think of the man pursued
comparing his own photograph with his present likeness,
under the eyes of the detective who had grown stale
in the chase of him.</p>

<p>He knew of incidents quite as remarkable, which had
a decent explanation afterwards, however. He went about
among the common people of Cherry Hill, who had known
Arthur Dillon from his baptism, had petted him every
week until he disappeared, and now adored him in his success.
He renewed acquaintance with them, and heaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
them with favors. Loitering about in their idling places,
he threw out the questions; hints, surmises, which might
bring to the surface their faith in Arthur Dillon. He reported
the result to Edith.</p>

<p>"Not one of them" said he, "but would go to court
and swear a bushel of oaths that Arthur Dillon is the
boy who ran away. They have their reasons too; how
he dances, and sings, and plays the fiddle, and teases the
girls, just as he did when a mere strip of a lad; how the
devil was always in him for doing the thing that no one
looked for; how he had no fear of even the priest, or of
the wildest horse; and sought out terrible things to do
and to dare, just as now he shakes up your late backers,
bishops, ministers, ambassadors, editors, or plots against
England; all as if he earned a living that way."</p>

<p>She sneered at this bias, and bade him search deeper.</p>

<p>It was necessary to approach the Senator on the matter.
He secured from him a promise that their talk would remain
a secret, not only because the matter touched one
very dear to the Senator, but also because publicity might
ruin the detective himself. If the Senator did not care
to give his word, there would be no talk, but his relative
might also be exposed to danger. The Senator was always
gracious with Curran.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about Arthur's history in
California?" and his lazy eyes noted every change in the
ruddy, handsome face.</p>

<p>"Never asked him but one question about it. He answered
that straight, and never spoke since about it.
Nothing wrong, I hope?" the Senator answered with
alarm.</p>

<p>"Lots, I guess, but I don't know for sure. Here are
the circumstances. Think them out for yourself. A
crowd of sharp speculators in California mines bought a
mine from Arthur Dillon when he was settling up his
accounts to come home to his mother. As trouble arose
lately about that mine, they had to hunt up Arthur Dillon.
They send their agent to New York, he comes to Arthur,
and has a talk with him. Then he goes back to his
speculators, and declares to them that this Arthur
Dillon is not the man who sold the mine. So the company,
full of suspicion, offers me the job of looking up
the character of Arthur, and what he had been doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
these ten years. They say straight out that the real
Arthur Dillon has been put out of the way, and that the
man who is holding the name and the stakes here in New
York is a fraud."</p>

<p>This bit of fiction relieved the Senator's mind.</p>

<p>"A regular cock-and-bull story," said he with indignation.
"What's their game? Did you tell them what
we think of Artie? Would his own mother mistake him?
Or even his uncle? If they're looking for hurt, tell them
they're on the right road."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Curran, "these are straight men. But
if doubt is cast on a business transaction, they intend to
clear it away. It would be just like them to bring suit
to establish the identity of Arthur with the Arthur Dillon
who sold them the mine. Now, Senator, could you
go into court and swear positively that the young man
who came back from California five years ago is the
nephew who ran away from home at the age of fifteen?"</p>

<p>"Swear it till I turned blue; why, it's foolish, simply
foolish. And every man, woman, and child in the district
would do the same. Why don't you go and talk
with Artie about it?"</p>

<p>"Because the company doesn't wish to make a fuss
until they have some ground to walk on," replied Curran
easily. "When I tell them how sure the relatives and
friends of Arthur are about his identity, they may drop
the affair. But now, Senator, just discussing the thing
as friends, you know, if you were asked in court why you
were so sure Arthur is your nephew, what could you tell
the court?"</p>

<p>"If the court asked me how I knew my mother was my
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's well enough, I know. But in this case Arthur
was absent ten years, in which time you never saw him,
heard of him, or from him."</p>

<p>"Good point," said the Senator musingly. "When
Artie came home from California, he was sick, and I went
to see him. He was in bed. Say, I'll never forget it,
Curran. I saw Pat sick once at the same age ... Pat
was his father, d'ye see?... and here was Pat lying
before me in the bed. I tell you it shook me. I never
thought he'd grow so much like his father, though he
has the family features. Know him to be Pat's son?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Why, if he told me himself he was any one else, I wouldn't
believe him."</p>

<p>Evidently the Senator knew nothing of Horace Endicott
and recognised Arthur Dillon as his brother's son. The
detective was not surprised; neither was Edith at the daily
report.</p>

<p>"There isn't another like him on earth," she said with
the pride of a discoverer. "Keep on until you find his
tracks, here or in California."</p>

<p>Curran had an interesting chat with Judy Haskell on a
similar theme, but with a different excuse from that
which roused the Senator. The old lady knew the detective
only as Arthur's friend. He approached her mysteriously,
with a story of a gold mine awaiting Arthur in
California, as soon as he could prove to the courts that
he was really Arthur Dillon. Judy began to laugh.
"Prove that he's Arthur Dillon! Faith, an' long I'd wait
for a gold mine if I had to prove I was Judy Haskell.
How can any one prove themselves to be themselves, Misther
Curran? Are the courts goin' crazy?"</p>

<p>The detective explained what evidence a court would
accept as proof of personality.</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur can give that aisy enough," said she.</p>

<p>"But he won't touch the thing at all, Mrs. Haskell.
He was absent ten years, and maybe he doesn't want that
period ripped up in a court. It might appear that he had
a wife, you know, or some other disagreeable thing might
leak out. When the lawyers get one on the witness
stand, they make hares of him."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," said Judy thoughtfully. Had she
not suggested this very suspicion to Anne? The young
are wild, and even Arthur could have slipped from grace
in that interval of his life. Curran hoped that Arthur
could prove his identity without exposing the secrets of
the past.</p>

<p>"For example," said he smoothly, with an eye for
Judy's expression, "could you go to court to-morrow and
swear that Arthur is the same lad that ran away from his
mother fifteen years ago?"</p>

<p>"I cud swear as manny oaths on that point as there are
hairs in yer head," said Judy.</p>

<p>"And what would you say, Mrs. Haskell, if the judge
said to you: Now, madam, it's very easy for you to say you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
know the young man to be the same person as the runaway
boy; but how do you know it? what makes you
think you know it?"</p>

<p>"I'd say he was purty sassy, indade. Of coorse I'd
say that to meself, for ye can't talk to a judge as aisy
an' free as to a lawyer. Well, I'd say manny pleasant
things. Arthur was gone tin years, but I knew him an'
he knew me the minute we set eyes on aich other. Then,
agin, I knew him out of his father. He doesn't favor
the mother at all, for she's light an' he's dark. There's a
dale o' the Dillon in him. Then, agin, how manny things
he tould me of the times we had together, an' he even
asked me if Teresa Flynn, his sweetheart afore he wint off,
was livin' still. Oh, as thrue as ye're sittin' there! Poor
thing, she was married. An' he remembered how fond
he was o' rice puddin' ice cold. An' he knew Louis Everard
the minute he shtud forninst him in the door. But
what's the use o' talkin'? I cud tell ye for hours all
the things he said an' did to show he was Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>"Has he any marks on his body that would help to
identify him, if he undertook to get the gold mine that
belongs to him?"</p>

<p>"Artie had only wan mark on him as a boy ... he was
the most spotless child I ever saw ... an' that was a mole
on his right shoulder. He tuk it wid him to California, an'
he brought it back, for I saw it meself in the same spot while
he was sick, an' I called his attintion to it, an' he was much
surprised, for he had never thought of it wanst."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," said Curran solemnly, "that he can
prove his identity without exposing his life in the west.
I hope to persuade him to it. Maybe the photographs of
himself and his father would help. Have you any copies
of them?"</p>

<p>"There's jist two. I wudn't dare to take thim out of
his room, but if ye care to walk up-stairs, Mr. Curran, an'
luk at thim there, ye're welcome. He an' his mother are
away the night to a gran' ball."</p>

<p>They entered Arthur's apartments together, and Judy
showed the pictures of Arthur Dillon as a boy of fourteen,
and of his youthful father; old daguerreotypes, but faithful
and clear as a likeness. Judy rattled on for an hour,
but the detective had achieved his object. She had no
share in the secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur Dillon was his father's son, for her. He studied
the pictures, and carefully examined the rooms, his admiration
provoking Judy into a display of their beauties. With
the skill and satisfaction of an artist in man-hunting, he
observed how thoroughly the character of the young man
displayed itself in the trifles of decoration and furnishing.</p>

<p>The wooden crucifix with the pathetic figure in bronze
on the wall over the desk, the holy water stoup at the
door, carved figures of the Holy Family, a charming group,
on the desk, exquisite etchings of the Christ and the
Madonna after the masters, a <i>prie-dieu</i> in the inner room
with a group of works of devotion: and Edith had declared
him no Catholic. Here was the refutation.</p>

<p>"He is a pious man," Curran said.</p>

<p>"And no wan sees it but God and himself. So much
the betther, I say," Judy remarked. "Only thim that
had sorra knows how to pray, an' he prays like wan that
had his fill of it."</p>

<p>The tears came into the man's eyes at the indications of
Arthur's love for poor Erin. Hardness was the mark of
Curran, and sin had been his lifelong delight; but for
his country he had kept a tenderness and devotion that
softened and elevated his nature at times. Of little use
and less honor to his native land, he felt humbled in this
room, whose books, pictures, and ornaments revealed
thought and study in behalf of a harried and wretched
people, yet the student was not a native of Ireland. It
seemed profane to set foot here, to spy upon its holy privacy.
He felt glad that its details gave the lie so emphatically
to Edith's instincts.</p>

<p>The astonishing thing was the absence of Californian
relics and mementoes. Some photographs and water
colors, whose names Curran mentally copied for future
use, pictured popular scenes on the Pacific slope; but
they could be bought at any art store. Surely his life in
the mines, with all the luck that had come to him, must
have held some great bitterness, that he never spoke of it
casually, and banished all remembrances.</p>

<p>That would come up later, but Curran had made up his
mind that no secret of Arthur's life should ever see the
light because he found it. Not even vengeful Edith, and
she had the right to hate her enemy, should wring from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
him any disagreeable facts in the lad's career. So deeply
the detective respected him!</p>

<p>In the place of honor, at the foot of his bed, where his
eyes rested on them earliest and latest, hung a group of
portraits in oil, in the same frame, of Louis the beloved,
from his babyhood to the present time: on the side wall
hung a painting of Anne in her first glory as mistress of
the new home in Washington Square; opposite, Monsignor
smiled down in purple splendor; two miniatures contained
the grave, sweet, motherly face of Mary Everard and the
auburn hair and lovely face of Mona.</p>

<p>"There are the people he loves," said Curran with emotion.</p>

<p>"Ay, indade," Judy said tenderly, "an' did ever a wild
boy like him love his own more? Night an' day his wan
thought is of them. The sun rises an' sets for him behind
that picther there," pointing to Louis' portraits. "If
annythin' had happened to that lovely child last Spring he'd
a-choked the life out o' wan woman wid his own two hands.
He's aisy enough, God knows, but I'd rather jump into
the say than face him when the anger is in him."</p>

<p>"He's a terrible man," said Curran, repeating Edith's
phrase.</p>

<p>He examined some manuscript in Arthur's handwriting.
How different from the careless scrawl of Horace Endicott
this clear, bold, dashing script, which ran full speed across
the page, yet turned with ease and leisurely from the
margin. What a pity Edith could not see with her own
eyes these silent witnesses to the truth. Beyond the study
was a music-room, where hung his violin over some scattered
music. Horace Endicott hated the practising of the
art, much as he loved the opera. It was all very sweet,
just what the detective would have looked for, beautiful
to see. He could have lingered in the rooms and speculated
on that secret and manly life, whose currents were
so feebly but shiningly indicated in little things. It occurred
to him that copies of the daguerreotypes, Arthur
at fourteen and his father at twenty-five, would be of service
in the search through California. He spoke of it to
Judy.</p>

<p>"Sure that was done years ago," said Judy cautiously.
"Anne Dillon wouldn't have it known for the world, ye
see, but I know that she sint a thousand o' thim to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
polis in California; an' that's the way she kem across the
lad. Whin he found his mother shtill mournin' him, he
wrote to her that he had made his pile an' was comin'
home. Anne has the pride in her, an' she wants all the
world to believe he kem home of himself, d'ye see? Now
kape that a secret, mind."</p>

<p>"And do you never let on what I've been telling you,"
said Curran gravely. "It may come to nothing, and it
may come to much, but we must be silent."</p>

<p>She had given her word, and Judy's word was like the
laws of the Medes and Persians. Curran rejoiced at the incident
of the daguerreotypes, which anticipated his proposed
search in California. Vainly however did he describe
the result of his inquiry for Edith. She would have none
of his inferences. He must try to entrap Anne Dillon
and the priest, and afterwards he might scrape the surface
of California.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE NERVE OF ANNE.</h3>


<p>Curran laid emphasis in his account to his wife on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
details of Arthur's rooms, and on the photographs which
had helped to discover the lost boy in California. Edith
laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Horace Endicott invented that scheme of the photographs,"
said she. "The dear clever boy! If he had
been the detective, not a stupid like you! I saw Arthur
Dillon in church many times in four years, and I tell you
he is not a Catholic born, no matter what you saw in his
rooms. He's playing the part of Arthur Dillon to the last
letter. Don't look at me that way, Dick or I'll scratch
your face. You want to say that I am crazy over this theory,
and that I have an explanation ready for all your objections."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say, I am just working on your
lines, dearie," he replied humbly.</p>

<p>"Just now your game is busy with an affair of the heart.
He won't be too watchful, unless, as I think, he's on our
tracks all the time. You ought to get at his papers."</p>

<p>"A love affair! Our tracks!" Curran repeated in confusion.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can catch a man like Arthur napping?"
she sneered. "Is there a moment in the last four
years that he has been asleep? See to it that you are not
reported to him every night. But if he is in love with
Honora Ledwith, there's a chance that he won't see or care
to see what you are doing. She's a lovely girl. A hint of
another woman would settle his chances of winning her.
I can give her that. I'd like to. A woman of her stamp
has no business marrying."</p>

<p>She mused a few minutes over her own statements,
while Curran stared. He began to feel that the threads
of this game were not all in his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must now go to the priest and Anne Dillon," she
resumed, "and say to them plump ... take the priest first ... say
to them plump before they can hold their faces
in shape: do you know Horace Endicott? Then watch
the faces, and get what you can out of them."</p>

<p>"That means you will have Arthur down on you next
day."</p>

<p>"Sure," catching her breath. "But it is now near
the end of the season. When he comes to have it out
with me, he will find himself face to face with Sonia. If
it's to be a fight, he'll find a tiger. Then we can run away
to California, if Sonia says so."</p>

<p>"You are going to bring Sonia down, then?"</p>

<p>"You suggested it. Lemme tell you what you're going
to find out to-day. You're going to find out that Monsignor
knew Horace Endicott. After that I think it would
be all right to bring down Sonia."</p>

<p>Little use to argue with her, or with any woman for that
matter, once an idea lodged so deep in her brain. He
went to see Monsignor, with the intention of being candid
with him: in fact there was no other way of dealing with
the priest. In his experience Curran had found no class so
difficult to deal with as the clergy. They were used to keeping
other people's secrets as well as their own. He did not
reveal his plan to Edith, because he feared her criticism, and
could not honestly follow her methods. He had not, with
all his skill and cunning, her genius for ferreting.</p>

<p>Monsignor, acquainted with him, received him coldly.
Edith's instructions were, ask the question plump, watch
his face, and then run to Anne Dillon before she can be
warned by the Monsignor's messenger. Looking into the
calm, well-drilled countenance of the priest, Curran found
it impossible to surprise him so uncourteously. Anyway
the detective felt sure that there would be no surprise,
except at the mere question.</p>

<p>"I would like to ask you a question, Monsignor," said
Curran smoothly, "which I have no right to ask perhaps.
I am looking for a man who disappeared some time ago,
and the parties interested hope that you can give some information.
You can tell me if the question is at all impertinent,
and I will go. Do you know Horace Endicott?"</p>

<p>There was no change in the priest's expression or
manner, no starting, no betrayal of feeling. Keeping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
eyes on the detective's face, he repeated the name as one
utters a half-forgotten thing.</p>

<p>"Why has that name a familiar sound?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"You may have read it frequently in the papers at the
time Horace Endicott disappeared," Curran suggested.</p>

<p>"Possibly, but I do not read the journals so carefully,"
Monsignor answered musingly. "Endicott, Endicott ... I
have it ... and it brings to my mind the incident of the
only railroad wreck in which I have ever had the misfortune
to be ... only this time it was good fortune for one
poor man."</p>

<p>Very deliberately he told the story of the collision and
of his slight acquaintance with the young fellow whose
name, as well as he could remember, was Endicott. The
detective handed him a photograph of the young man.</p>

<p>"How clearly this picture calls up the whole scene,"
said Monsignor much pleased. "This is the very boy.
Have you a copy of this? Do send me one."</p>

<p>"You can keep that," said Curran, delighted at his progress,
astonished that Edith's prophecy should have come
true. Naturally the next question would be, have you seen
the young man since that time? and Curran would have
asked it had not the priest broken in with a request for the
story of his disappearance. It was told.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall be delighted to give what information
I possess," said Monsignor. "There was no secret about
him then ... many others saw him ... of course this must
have been some time before he disappeared. But let me ask
a question before we go any further. How did you suspect
my acquaintance with a man whom I met so casually?
The incident had almost faded from my mind. In fact I
have never mentioned it to a soul."</p>

<p>"It was a mere guess on the part of those interested in
finding him."</p>

<p>"Still the guess must have been prompted by some theory
of the search."</p>

<p>"I am almost ashamed to tell it," Curran said uneasily.
"The truth is that my employers suspect that Horace
Endicott has been hiding for years under the character of
Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>Monsignor looked amazed for a moment and then
laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Interesting for Mr. Dillon and his friends, particularly
if this Endicott is wanted for any crime...."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," cried the detective. "It is his wife who
is seeking him, a perfectly respectable man, you know ...
it's a long story. We have chased many a man supposed
to be Endicott, and Mr. Dillon is the latest. I don't
accept the theory myself. I know Dillon is Dillon, but a
detective must sift the theories of his employers. In fact
my work up to this moment proves very clearly that of all
our wrong chases this is the worst."</p>

<p>"It looks absurd at first sight. I remember the time
poor Mrs. Dillon sent out her photographs, scattered a few
hundred of them among the police and the miners of
California, in the hope of finding her lost son. That
was done with my advice. She had her first response, a
letter from her son, about the very time that I met young
Endicott. For the life of me I cannot understand why
anyone should suppose Arthur Dillon...."</p>

<p>He picked up the photograph of Endicott again.</p>

<p>"The two men look as much alike as I look like you.
I'm glad you mentioned the connection which Dillon has
with the matter. You will kindly leave me out of it until
you have made inquiries of Mr. Dillon himself. It would
not do, you understand, for a priest in my position to give
out any details in a matter which may yet give trouble. I
fear that in telling you of my meeting with Endicott I
have already overstepped the limits of prudence. However,
that was my fault, as you warned me. Thanks for the
photograph, a very nice souvenir of a tragedy. Poor
young fellow! Better had he perished in the smash-up
than to go out of life in so dreary a way."</p>

<p>"If I might venture another&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, not another word. In any official and public
way I am always ready to tell what the law requires, or
charity demands."</p>

<p>"You would be willing then to declare that Arthur
Dillon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Dillon's son? Certainly ... at any time,
under proper conditions. Good morning. Don't mention
it," and Curran was outside the door before his thoughts
took good shape; so lost in wonder over the discovery of
Monsignor's acquaintance with Endicott, that he forgot to
visit Anne Dillon. Instead he hurried home with the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to Edith, and blushed with shame when she asked if he
had called on Anne. She forgave his stupidity in her delight,
and put him through his catechism on all that had
been said and seen in the interview with Monsignor.</p>

<p>"You are a poor stick," was her comment, and for the
first time in years he approved of her opinion. "The
priest steered you about and out with his little finger, and
the corner of his eye. He did not give you a chance to
ask if he had ever seen Horace Endicott since. Monsignor
will not lie for any man. He simply refuses to answer
on the ground that his position will not permit it. You
will never see the priest again on this matter. Arthur
Dillon will bid you stand off. Well, you see what my instinct
is now! Are you more willing to believe in it when
it says: Arthur Dillon is Horace Endicott?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, sweetheart."</p>

<p>"I won't fight with you, since you are doing as I order.
Go to Anne Dillon now. Mind, she's already prepared by
this time for your visit. You may run against Arthur instead
of her. While you are gone I shall write to Sonia
that we have at last found a clue, and ask her to come on
at once. Dillon may not give us a week to make our escape
after he learns what we have been doing. We must
be quick. Go, my dear old stupid, and bear in mind that
Anne Dillon is the cunningest cat you've had to do with
yet."</p>

<p>She gave an imitation of the lady that was funny to a
degree, and sent the detective off laughing, but not at all
convinced that there was any significance in his recent discovery.
He felt mortified to learn again for the hundredth
time how a prejudice takes the edge off intellect. Though
certain Edith's theory was wrong, why should he act like a
donkey in disproving it? On the contrary his finest skill
was required, and methods as safe as if Dillon were sure
to turn out Endicott. He sharpened his blade for the
coming duel with Anne, whom Monsignor had warned,
without doubt. However, Anne had received no warning
and she met Curran with her usual reserve. He was
smoothly brutal.</p>

<p>"I would like to know if you are acquainted with Mr.
Horace Endicott?" said he.</p>

<p>Anne's face remained as blank as the wall, and her manner
tranquil. She had never heard the name before, for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the transactions between herself and her son only the name
of Arthur Dillon had been mentioned, while of his previous
life she knew not a single detail. Curran not disappointed,
hastened, after a pause, to explain his own rudeness.</p>

<p>"I never heard the name," said Anne coldly. "Nor do
I see by what right you come here and ask questions."</p>

<p>"Pardon my abruptness," said the detective. "I am
searching for a young man who disappeared some years
ago, and his friends are still hunting for him, still anxious,
so that they follow the most absurd clues. I am forced
to ask this question of all sorts of people, only to get the
answer which you have given. I trust you will pardon me
for my presumption for the sake of people who are suffering."</p>

<p>His speech warned her that she had heard her son's
name for the first time, that she stood on the verge of exposure;
and her heart failed her, she felt that her voice
would break if she ventured to speak, her knees give way
if she resented this man's manner by leaving the room.
Yet the weakness was only for a moment, and when it
passed a wild curiosity to hear something of that past
which had been a sealed book to her, to know the real personality
of Arthur Dillon, burned her like a flame, and
steadied her nerves. For two years she had been resenting
his secrecy, not understanding his reasons. He was
guarding against the very situation of this moment.</p>

<p>"Horace Endicott," she repeated with interest.
"There is no one of that name in my little circle, and I
have never heard the name before. Who was he? And
how did he come to be lost?"</p>

<p>And she rose to indicate that his reply must be brief.</p>

<p>Curran told with eloquence of the disappearance and the
long search, and gave a history of Endicott's life in nice
detail, pleased with the unaffected interest of this severe
but elegant woman. As he spoke his eye took in every
mark of feeling, every gesture, every expression. Her
self-command, if she knew Horace Endicott, remained
perfect; if she knew him not, her manner seemed natural.</p>

<p>"God pity his poor people," was her fervent comment
as she took her seat again. "I was angry with you at
first, sir," looking at his card, "and of a mind to send you
away for what looked like impertinence. But it's I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
be only too glad to give you help if I could. I never even
heard the young man's name. And it puzzles me, why
you should come to me."</p>

<p>"For this reason, Mrs. Dillon," he said with sincere
disgust. "The people who are hunting for Horace Endicott
think that Arthur Dillon is the man; or to put it in
another way, that you were deceived when you welcomed
back your son from California. Horace Endicott and not
Arthur Dillon returned."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried she, and sat staring at him; then
rose up and began to move towards the door backwards,
keeping an eye upon him. Her thought showed clear to
the detective: she had been entertaining a lunatic. He
laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he said. "I know what you imagine, but
I'm no lunatic. I don't believe that your son is an impostor.
He is a friend of mine, and I know that he is
Arthur Dillon. But a man in my business must do as he
is ordered by his employers. I am a detective."</p>

<p>For a minute she hesitated with hand outstretched to the
bell-rope. Her mind acted with speed; she had nothing
to fear, the man was friendly, his purpose had failed, whatever
it was, the more he talked the more she would learn,
and it might be in her power to avert danger by policy.
She went back to her seat, having left it only to act her
part. Taking the hint provided by Curran, she pretended
belief in his insanity, and passed to indignation at
this attempt upon her happiness, her motherhood. This
rage became real, when she reflected that the Aladdin
palace of her life was really threatened by Curran's employers.
To her the prosperity and luxury of the past five
years had always been dream-like in its fabric, woven of
the mists of morning, a fairy enchantment, which might
vanish in an hour and leave poor Cinderella sitting on a
pumpkin by the roadside, the sport of enemies, the burden
of friends. How near she had been to this public humiliation!
What wretches, these people who employed the detective!</p>

<p>"My dear boy was absent ten years," she said, "and I
suffered agony all that time. What hearts must some
people have to wish to put me through another time like
that! Couldn't any wan see that I accepted him as my
son? that all the neighbors accepted him? What could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a man want to deceive a poor mother so? I had nothing
to give him but the love of a mother, and men care little
for that, wild boys care nothing for it. He brought me a
fortune, and has made my life beautiful ever since he
came back. I had nothing to give him. Who is at the
bottom of this thing?"</p>

<p>The detective explained the existence and motives of a
deserted, poverty-stricken wife and child.</p>

<p>"I knew a woman would be at the bottom of it," she
exclaimed viciously, feeling against Sonia a hatred which
she knew to be unjust. "Well, isn't she able to recognize
her own husband? If I could tell my son after ten years,
when he had grown to be a man, can't she tell her own
husband after a few years? Could it be that my boy
played Horace Endicott in Boston and married that
woman, and then came back to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Mrs. Dillon," cried the detective in
alarm, "do not excite yourself over so trifling a thing.
Your son is your son no matter what our theories may
be. This Endicott was born and brought up in the
vicinity of Boston, and came from a very old family.
Your suspicion is baseless. Forget the whole matter I
beg of you."</p>

<p>"Have you a picture of the young man?"</p>

<p>He handed her the inevitable photograph reluctantly,
quite sure that she would have hysterics before he left, so
sincere was her excitement. Anne studied the portrait
with keen interest, it may be imagined, astonished to find
it so different from Arthur Dillon. Had she blundered as
well as the detective? Between this portrait and any of
the recent photographs of Arthur there seemed no apparent
resemblance in any feature. She had been exciting
herself for nothing.</p>

<p>"Wonderful are the ways of men," was her comment.
"How any one ..." her brogue had left her ... "could
take Arthur Dillon for this man, even supposing he was
disguised now, is strange and shameful. What is to be
the end of it?"</p>

<p>"Just this, dear madam," said Curran, delighted at her
returning calmness. "I shall tell them what you have
said, what every one says, and they'll drop the inquiry as
they have dropped about one hundred others. If they are
persistent, I shall add that you are ready to go into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
court in the land and swear positively that you know your
own son."</p>

<p>"Into twenty courts," she replied with fervor, and the
tears, real tears came into her eyes; then, at sight of
Aladdin's palace as firm as ever on its frail foundations,
the tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Precisely. And now if you would be kind enough to
keep this matter from the ears of Mr. Dillon ... he's a
great friend of mine ... I admire him ... I was with
him in the little expedition to Ireland, you know ... and
it was to save him pain that I came to you first ... if it
could be kept quiet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want it kept quiet," she said with decision, "but at
the same time Arthur must know of these cruel suspicions.
Oh, how my heart beats when I think of it! Without
him ten years, and then to have strangers plan to take
him from me altogether ... forever ... forever ... oh!"</p>

<p>Curran perspired freely at the prospect of violent
hysterics. No man could deal more rudely with the weak
and helpless with right on his side, or if his plans demanded
it. Before a situation like this he felt lost and
foolish.</p>

<p>"Certainly he must know in time. I shall tell him myself,
as soon as I make my report of the failure of this
clue to my employers. I would take it as a very great
favor if you would permit me to tell him. It must come
very bitter to a mother to tell her son that he is suspected
of not being her son. Let me spare you that anguish."</p>

<p>Anne played with him delightfully, knowing that she
had him at her mercy, not forgetting however that the
sport was with tigers. Persuaded to wait a few days while
Curran made his report, in return he promised to inform
her of the finding of poor Endicott at the proper
moment. The detective bowed himself out, the lady
smiled. A fair day's work! She had learned the name
and the history of the young man known as Arthur Dillon
in a most delightful way. The doubt attached to this
conclusion did not disturb her. Wonderful, that Arthur
Dillon should look so little like the portrait of Horace
Endicott! More wonderful still that she, knowing
Arthur was not her son, had come to think of him, to feel
towards him, and to act accordingly, as her son! Her
rage over this attempt upon the truth and the fact of their
relationship grew to proportions.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">UNDER THE EYES OF HATE.</h3>


<p>Edith's inference from the interviews with the Monsignor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and Anne did justice to her acuteness. The priest alone
knew the true personality of Arthur. From Anne all but
the fact of his disappearance had been kept, probably to
guard against just such attempts as Curran's. The detective
reminded her that her theory stood only because
of her method of selection from his investigations. Nine
facts opposed and one favored her contention: therefore
nine were shelved, leaving one to support the edifice of
her instincts or her suspicions. She stuck out her tongue
at him.</p>

<p>"It shows how you are failing when nine out of ten
facts, gathered in a whole day's work, are worthless. Isn't
that one fact, that the priest knew Horace Endicott,
worth all your foolish reasonings? Who discovered it?
Now, will you coax Sonia Endicott down here to have a
look at this Arthur Dillon? Before we start for California?"</p>

<p>He admitted humbly that the lady would not accept his
invitation, without stern evidence of a valuable clue. The
detectives had given her many a useless journey.</p>

<p>"She'll be at the Everett House to-morrow early in the
morning," said Edith proudly. "Want to know why,
stupid? I sent her a message that her game had been
treed at last ... by me."</p>

<p>He waved his hands in despair.</p>

<p>"Then you'll do the talking, Madam Mischief."</p>

<p>"And you'll never say a word, even when asked. What!
would I let you mesmerize her at the start by telling her
how little you think of my idea and my plans? She
would think as little of them as you do, when you got
through. No! I shall tell her, I shall plan for her, I
shall lead her to the point of feeling where that long experience
with Horace Endicott will become of some use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
piercing the disguise of Arthur Dillon. You would convince
her she was not to see Horace Endicott, and of
course she would see only Arthur Dillon. I'll convince
her she is to see her runaway husband, and then if she
doesn't I'll confess defeat."</p>

<p>"There's a good deal in your method," he admitted in
a hopeless way.</p>

<p>"We are in for it now," she went on, scorning the compliment.
"By this time Arthur Dillon knows, if he did
not before, that I am up to mischief. He may fall on us
any minute. He will not suffer this interference: not
because he cares two cents one way or the other, but because
he will not have us frightening his relatives and
friends, telling every one that he is two. Keep out of his
way so that he shall have to come here, and to send word
first that he is coming. I'll arrange a scene for him with
his Sonia. It may be sublime, and again it may be a
fizzle. One way or the other, if Sonia says so, we'll fly to
the west out of his way. The dear, dear boy!"</p>

<p>"He'll <i>dear</i> you after that scene!"</p>

<p>"Now, do you make what attempts you may to find out
where he keeps his money, he must have piles of it, and
search his papers, his safe...."</p>

<p>"He has nothing of the kind ... everything about
him is as open as the day ... it's an impertinence to
bother him so ... well, he can manage you, I think ... no
need for me to interfere or get irritated."</p>

<p>Then she had a tantrum, which galled the soul of Curran,
except that it ended as usual in her soft whimpering,
her childish murmuring, her sweet complaint against the
world, and her falling asleep in his arms. Thus was he
regularly conquered and led captive.</p>

<p>They went next day at noon to visit Sonia Endicott at
the Everett House, where she had established herself with
her little boy and his nurse. Her reception of the Currans,
while supercilious in expression, was really sincere.
They represented her hope in that long search of five
years, which only a vigorous hate had kept going.
Marked with the characteristics of the cat, velvety to eye
and touch, insolent and elusive in her glance, undisciplined,
she could act a part for a time. To Horace
Endicott she had played the rôle of a child of light, an
elf, a goddess, for which nature had dressed her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
golden hair, melting eyes of celestial blue, and exquisite
form.</p>

<p>The years had brought out the animal in her. She
found it more and more difficult to repress the spite, rage,
hatred, against Horace and fate, which consumed her
within, and violated the external beauty with unholy
touches, wrinkles, grimaces, tricks of sneering, distortions
of rage. Her dreams of hatred had only one scene: a
tiger in her own form rending the body of the man who
had discovered and punished her with a power like omnipotence;
rending him but not killing him, leaving his
heart to beat and his face unmarked, that he might feel
his agony and show it.</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> had sent me the telegram," she remarked to
Curran, "I would not have come. But this dear Colette,
she is to be my good angel and lead me to success, aren't
you, little devil? Ever since she took up the matter I
have had my beautiful dreams once more, oh, such
thrilling dreams! Like the novels of Eugene Sue, just
splendid. Well, why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>He pointed to Edith with a gesture of submission. She
was hugging the little boy before the nurse took him away,
teasing him into baby talk, kissing him decorously but
lavishly, as if she could not get enough of him.</p>

<p>"He's not to speak until asked," she cried.</p>

<p>"And then only say what she thinks," he added.</p>

<p>"La! are you fighting over it already? That's not a
good sign."</p>

<p>With a final embrace which brought a howl from young
Horace, Edith gave the boy to the nurse and began her
story of finding Horace Endicott in the son of Anne Dillon.
She acted the story, admirably keeping back the
points which would have grated on Sonia's instincts, or
rather expectations. The lady, impressed, evidently felt
a lack of something when Curran refused his interest and
his concurrence to the description.</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?" said she.</p>

<p>"To see this Dillon and to study him, as one would a
problem. The man's been playing this part, living it indeed,
nearly five years. Can any one expect that the
first glance will pierce his disguise? He must be watched
and studied for days, and if that fetches nothing, then you
must meet him suddenly, and say to him tenderly, 'at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
last, Horace!' If that fetches nothing, then we must go
to California, and work until we get the evidence which
will force him to acknowledge himself and give up his
money. But by that time, if we can make sure it is he,
and if we can get his money, then I would recommend one
thing! Kill him!"</p>

<p>Sonia's eyes sparkled at the thought of that sweet
murder.</p>

<p>"And wait another five years for all this," was her
cynical remark.</p>

<p>"If the question is not settled this Fall, then let it go
forever," said Edith with energy.</p>

<p>"The scheme is well enough," Sonia said lazily. "Is
this Arthur Dillon handsome, a dashing blade?"</p>

<p>"Better," murmured Edith with a smack of her lips,
"a virtuous sport, who despises the sex in a way, and can
master woman by a look. He is my master. And I hate
him! It will be worth your time to see him and meet him."</p>

<p>"And now you," to Curran.</p>

<p>Sonia did not know, nor care why Edith hated Dillon.</p>

<p>"I protest, Sonia. He will put a spell on you, and spoil
our chances. Let him talk later when we have succeeded
or failed."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you fool. I must hear both sides, but I
declare now that I submit myself to you wholly. What
do you say, Curran?"</p>

<p>"Just this, madam: if this man Arthur Dillon is really
your husband, then he's too clever to be caught by any
power in this world. Any way you choose to take it, you
will end as this search has always ended."</p>

<p>"Why do you think him so clever? My Horace was
anything but clever ... at least we thought so ... until
now."</p>

<p>"Until he has foiled every attempt to find him," said
Curran. "Colette has her own ideas, but she has kept
back all the details that make or unmake a case. She is
so sure of her instincts! No doubt they are good."</p>

<p>"But not everything, hey?" said the lady tenderly.
"Ah, a woman's instincts lead her too far sometimes...."
they all laughed. "Well, give me the details Colette left
out. No winking at each other. I won't raise a hand in
this matter until I have heard both sides."</p>

<p>"This Arthur Dillon is Irish, and lives among the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in the old-fashioned Irish way, half in the slums, and half
in the swell places...."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, what is this I hear! The Irish! My
Horace live among the Irish! That's not the man. He
could live anywhere, among the Chinese, the Indians, the
niggers, but with that low class of people, never!" and
she threw up her hands in despair. "Did I come from
Boston to pursue a low Irishman!"</p>

<p>"You see," cried Edith. "Already he has cast his
spell on you. He doesn't believe I have found your man,
and he won't let you believe it. Can't you see that this
Horace went to the very place where you were sure he
would not go?"</p>

<p>"You cannot tell him now from an Irishman," continued
the detective. "He has an Irish mother, he is a member
of Tammany Hall, he is a politician who depends on Irish
voters, he joined the Irish revolutionists and went over the
sea to fight England, and he's in love with an Irish
girl."</p>

<p>"Shocking! Horace never had any taste or any sense,
but I know he detested the Irish around Boston. I can't
believe it of him. But, as Colette says truly, he would
hide himself in the very place where we least think of
looking for him."</p>

<p>"Theories have come to nothing," screamed Edith,
until the lady placed her hands on her ears. "Skill and
training and coolness and all that rot have come to
nothing. Because I hate Arthur Dillon I have discovered
Horace Endicott. Now I want to see your eyes looking
at this man, eyes with hate in them, and with murder in
them. They will discover more than all the stupid detectives
in the country. See what hate did for Horace
Endicott. He hated you, and instead of murdering you
he learned to torture you. He hated you, and it made
him clever. Oh, hate is a great teacher! This fool of
mine loves Arthur Dillon, because he is a patriot and hates
England. Hate breeds cleverness, it breeds love, it opens
the mind, it will dig out Horace Endicott and his fortune,
and enrich us all."</p>

<p>"La, but you are strenuous," said the lady placidly,
but impressed. She was a shallow creature in the main,
and Curran compared his little wife, eloquent, glowing
with feeling, dainty as a flame, to the slower-witted beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
with plain admiration in his gaze. She deserves to succeed,
he thought. Sonia came to a conclusion, languidly.</p>

<p>"We must try the eyes of hate," was her decision.</p>

<p>The pursuit of Arthur proved very interesting. The
detective knew his habits of labor and amusement, his
public haunts and loitering-places. Sonia saw him first at
the opera, modestly occupying a front seat in the balcony.</p>

<p>"Horace would never do that when he could get a box,"
and she leveled her glass at him.</p>

<p>Edith mentally dubbed her a fool. However, her study
of the face and figure and behavior of the man showed care
and intelligence. Edith's preparation had helped her. She
saw a lean, nervous young man, whose flowing black hair
and full beard were streaked with gray. His dark face,
hollow in the cheeks and not too well-colored with the glow
of health, seemed to get light and vivacity from his melancholy
eyes. Seriousness was the characteristic expression.
Once he laughed, in the whole evening. Once he looked
straight into her face, with so fixed, so intense an expression,
so near a gaze, so intimate and penetrating, that she
gave a low cry.</p>

<p>"You have recognized him?" Edith whispered mad
with joy.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," she answered sadly, "That is not
Horace Endicott. Not a feature that I recall, certainly no
resemblance. I was startled because I saw just now in
his look, ... he looked towards me into the glass ... an
expression that seemed familiar ... as if I had seen it
before, and it had hurt me then as it hurts me now."</p>

<p>"There's a beginning," said Edith with triumph.
"Next time for a nearer look."</p>

<p>"Oh, he could never have changed so," Sonia cried
with bitterness of heart.</p>

<p>Curran secured tickets for a ball to be held by a political
association in the Cherry Hill district, and placed the
ladies in a quiet corner of the gallery of the hall. Arthur
Dillon, as a leading spirit in the society, delighted to
mingle with the homely, sincere, warm-hearted, and simple
people for whom this occasion was a high festival; and
nowhere did his sorrow rest so lightly on his soul, nowhere
did he feel so keenly the delight of life, or give freer expression
to it. Edith kept Sonia at the highest pitch of excitement
and interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember," she said now, "that he probably knows
you are in town, that you are here watching him; but not
once will he look this way, nor do a thing other than if
you were miles away. My God, to be an actor like that!"</p>

<p>The actor played his part to perfection and to the utter
disappointment of the women. The serious face shone
now with smiles and color, with the flash of wit and the
play of humor. Horace Endicott had been a merry fellow,
but a Quaker compared with the butterfly swiftness
and gaiety of this young man, who led the grand march,
flirted with the damsels and chatted with the dames,
danced as often as possible, joked with the men, found
partners for the unlucky, and touched the heart of every
rollicking moment. The old ladies danced jigs with him,
proud to their marrow of the honor, and he allowed himself
... Sonia gasped at the sight ... to execute a wild
Irish <i>pas seul</i> amid the thunderous applause of the hearty
and adoring company.</p>

<p>"That man Horace Endicott!" she exclaimed with
contempt. "Bah! But it's interesting, of course."</p>

<p>"What a compliment! what acting! oh, incomparable
man!" said Edith, enraged at his success before such an
audience. Her husband smiled behind his hand.</p>

<p>"You have a fine imagination, Colette, but I would not
give a penny for your instinct," said Sonia.</p>

<p>"My instinct will win just the same, but I fear we shall
have to go to California. This man is too clever for commonplace
people."</p>

<p>"Arthur Dillon is a fine orator," said Curran mischievously,
"and to-morrow night you shall hear him at his
best on the sorrows of Ireland."</p>

<p>Sonia laughed heartily and mockingly. Were not these
same sorrows, from their constancy and from repetition,
become the joke of the world? Curran could have struck
her evil face for the laugh.</p>

<p>"Was your husband a speaker?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Horace would not demean himself to talk in public,
and he couldn't make a speech to save his life. But to
talk on the sorrows of Ireland ... oh, it's too absurd."</p>

<p>"And why not Ireland's sorrows as well as those of
America, or any other country?" he replied savagely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I quite forgot that you were Irish ... a thousand
pardons," she said with sneering civility. "Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
course, I shall be glad to hear his description of the sorrows.
An orator! It's very interesting."</p>

<p>The occasion for the display of Arthur's powers was one
of the numerous meetings for which the talking Irish are
famous all over the world, and in which their clever
speakers have received fine training. Even Sonia, impressed
by the enthusiasm of the gathering, and its esteem
for Dillon, could not withhold her admiration.
Alas, it was not her Horace who poured out a volume of
musical tone, vigorous English, elegant rhetoric, with the
expression, the abandonment, the picturesqueness of a
great actor. She shuddered at his descriptions, her heart
melted and her eyes moistened at his pathos, she became
filled with wonder. It was not Horace! Her husband
might have developed powers of eloquence, but would have
to be remade to talk in that fashion of any land. This
Dillon had terrible passion, and her Horace was only a
a handsome fool. She could have loved Dillon.</p>

<p>"So you will have to arrange the little scene where I
shall stand before him without warning, and murmur
tenderly, 'at last, Horace!' And it must be done
without delay," was her command to Edith.</p>

<p>"It can be done perhaps to-morrow night," Edith said
in a secret rage, wondering what Arthur Dillon could have
seen in Sonia. "But bear in mind why I am doing this
scene, with the prospects of a furious time afterwards with
Dillon. I want you to see him asleep, just for ten minutes,
in the light of a strong lamp. In sleep there is no disguise.
When he is dressed for a part and playing it, the sharpest
eyes, even the eyes of hate, may not be able to escape the
glamour of the disguise. The actor asleep is more like
himself. You shall look into his face, and turn it from
side to side with your own hands. If you do not catch
some feeling from that, strike a resemblance, I shall feel
like giving up."</p>

<p>"La, but you are an audacious creature," said Sonia,
and the triviality of the remark sent Edith into wild
laughter. She would like to have bitten the beauty.</p>

<p>The detective consented to Edith's plans, in his anxiety
to bring the farce to an end before the element of danger
grew. Up to this point they might appeal to Arthur for
mercy. Later the dogs would be upon them. As yet no
sign of irritation on Arthur's part had appeared. The day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
after the oration on the sorrows of Erin he sent a note to
Curran announcing his intention to call the same evening.
Edith, amazed at her own courage in playing with the fire
which in an instant could destroy her, against the warning
of her husband, was bent on carrying out the scene.</p>

<p>Dearly she loved the dramatic off the stage, spending
thought and time in its arrangement. How delicious the
thought of this man and his wife meeting under circumstances
so wondrous after five years of separation. Though
death reached her the next moment she would see it.
The weakness of the plot lay in Sonia's skepticism and
Arthur's knowledge that a trap was preparing. He would
brush her machinery aside like a cobweb, but that did not
affect the chance of his recognition by Sonia.</p>

<p>Dillon had never lost his interest in the dancer and her
husband. They attracted him. In their lives ran the
same strain of madness, the madness of the furies, as in
his own. Their lovable qualities were not few. Occasionally
he dropped in to tease Edith over her lack of conscience,
or her failures, and to discuss the cause of freedom
with the smooth and flinty Curran. Wild humans have
the charm of their wilderness. One must not forget their
teeth and their claws. This night the two men sat alone.
Curran filled the glasses and passed the cigars. Arthur
made no comment on the absence of Edith. He might
have been aware that the curtains within three feet of his
chair, hiding the room beyond, concealed the two women,
whose eyes, peering through small glasses fixed in the
curtains, studied his face. He might even have guessed
that his easy chair had been so placed as to let the light
fall upon him while Curran sat in the dim light beyond.
The young man gave no sign, spoke freely with Curran on
the business of the night, and acted as usual.</p>

<p>"Of course it must be stopped at once," he said.
"Very much flattered of course that I should be taken
for Horace Endicott ... you gave away Tom Jones'
name at last ... but these things, so trifling to you, jar
the nerves of women. Then it would never do for me,
with my little career in California unexplained, to have
stories of a double identity ... is that what you call it?...
running around. Of course I know it's that devil
Edith, presuming always on good nature ... that's <i>her</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>nature ... but if you don't stop it, why I must."</p>

<p>"You'll have to do it, I think," the detective replied
maliciously. "I can do only what she orders. I had to
satisfy her by running to the priest, and your mother, and
the Senator&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! even my poor uncle! Oh, Curran!"</p>

<p>"The whole town, for that matter, Mr. Dillon. It was
done in such a way, of course, that none of them suspected
anything wrong, and we talked under promise of secrecy.
I saw that the thing had to be done to satisfy her and to
bring you down on us. Now you're down and the trouble's
over as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"And Tom Jones was Horace Endicott," Arthur mused,
"I knew it of course all along, but I respected your confidence.
I had known Endicott."</p>

<p>"You knew Horace Endicott?" said Curran, horrified
by a sudden vision of his own stupidity.</p>

<p>"And his lady, a lovely, a superb creature, but just a
shade too sharp for her husband, don't you know. He
was a fool in love, wasn't he? judging from your story of
him. Has she become reconciled to her small income, I
wonder? She was not that kind, but when one has to,
that's the end of it. <i>And there are consolations.</i> How the
past month has tired me. I could go to sleep right in the
chair, only I want to settle this matter to-night, and I must
say a kind word to the little devil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice faded away, and he slept, quite overpowered
by the drug placed in his wine. After perfect silence for
a minute, Curran beckoned to the women, who came
noiseless into the room, and bent over the sleeping face.
In his contempt for them, the detective neither spoke nor
left his seat. Harpies brooding over the dead! Even he
knew that!</p>

<p>Arthur's face lay in profile, its lines all visible, owing to
the strong light, through the disguise of the beard. The
melancholy which marks the face of any sleeper, a foreshadow
of the eternal sleep, had become on this sleeper's
countenance a profound sadness. From his seat Curran
could see the pitiful droop of the mouth, the hollowness
of the eyes, the shadows under the cheek-bones; marks of
a sadness too deep for tears. Sonia took his face in her
soft hands and turned the right profile to the light. She
looked at the full face, smoothed his hair as if trying to
recall an ancient memory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"The eyes of hate," murmured Edith between tears and
rage. She pitied while she hated him, understanding the
sorrow that could mark a man's face so deeply, admiring
the courage which could wear the mask so well. Sonia
was deeply moved in spite of disappointment. At one moment
she caught a fleeting glimpse of her Horace, but too
elusive to hold and analyze. Something pinched her feelings
and the great tears fell from her soft eyes. Emotion
merely pinched her. Only in hate could she writhe and
foam and exhaust nature. She studied his hands, observed
the fingers, with the despairing conviction that this was
not the man; too lean and too coarse and too hard; and
her rage began to burn against destiny. Oh, to have Horace
as helpless under her hands! How she could rend
him!</p>

<p>"Do you see any likeness?" whispered Edith.</p>

<p>"None," was the despairing answer.</p>

<p>"Be careful," hissed Curran. "In this sleep words
are heard and remembered sometimes."</p>

<p>Edith swore the great oaths which relieved her anger.
But what use to curse, to look and curse again? At the
last moment Curran signalled them away, and began
talking about his surprise that Arthur should have known
the lost man.</p>

<p>"Because you might have given me a clue," Arthur
heard him saying as he came back from what he thought
had been a minute's doze, "and saved me a year's search,
not to mention the money I could have made."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about it some other time," said Arthur
with a yawn, as he lit a fresh cigar. "Ask madam to
step in here, will you. I must warn her in a wholesome
way."</p>

<p>"I think she is entertaining a friend," Curran said,
hinting plainly at a surprise.</p>

<p>"Let her bring the friend along," was the careless
answer.</p>

<p>The two women entered presently, and Edith made the
introduction. The husband and wife stood face to face at
last. Her voice failed in her throat from nervousness, so
sure was she that the Endicotts had met again! They had
the center of the stage, and the interest of the audience,
but acted not one whit like the people in a play.</p>

<p>"Delighted," said Arthur in his usual drawling way on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
these occasions. "I have had the pleasure of meeting
Mrs. Endicott before."</p>

<p>"Indeed," cried the lady. "I regret that my memory...."</p>

<p>"At Castle Moyna, a little fête, mother fainted because
she saw me running across the lawn ... of course you
remember...."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly ... we all felt so sorry for the
young singer ... her father...."</p>

<p>"He was in jail and died since, poor man. Then I saw
you coming across on the steamer with a dear, sweet, old
lady...."</p>

<p>"My husband's aunt," Sonia gasped at the thought of
Aunt Lois.</p>

<p>"Oh, but he's letter-perfect," murmured Edith in
admiration.</p>

<p>"And you might remember me," said the heartless fellow,
"but of course on a wedding-tour no one can expect
the parties to remember anything, as the guide for a
whole week to your party in California."</p>

<p>"Of course there was a guide," she admitted, very pleasant
to meet him again, and so on to the empty end.
Edith, stunned by her defeat, sat crushed, for this man no
more minded the presence of his wife than did Curran.
It was true. Arthur had often thought that a meeting
like this in the far-off years would rock his nature as an
earthquake rocks the solid plain. Though not surprised
at her appearance, for Edith's schemes had all been
foreseen, he felt surprise at his own indifference. So
utterly had she gone out of his thought, that her sudden
appearance, lovely and seductive as of old, gave him no
twinge of hate, fear, repugnance, disgust, horror, shame,
or pain.</p>

<p>He took no credit to himself for a self-control, which
he had not been called upon by any stress of feeling to exercise.
He was only Arthur Dillon, encountering a lady
with a past; a fact in itself more or less amusing.
Once she might have been a danger to be kept out like a
pest, or barricaded in quarantine. That time had gone
by. His indifference for the moment appalled him, since
it showed the hopeless depth of Endicott's grave. After
chatting honestly ten minutes, he went away light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
heart, without venturing to warn Edith. Another day,
he told her, and be good meanwhile.</p>

<p>Curran became thoughtful, and the women irritable
after he had gone. Edith felt that her instincts had no
longer a value in the market. In this wretched Endicott
affair striking disappointment met the most brilliant
endeavors. Sonia made ready to return to her hotel.
Dolorously the Currans paid her the last courtesies, waiting
for the word which would end the famous search for her
Horace.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking the matter over," she said
sweetly, "and I have thought out a plan, not in your line
of course, which I shall see to at once. I think it worth
while to look through California for points in the life of
this interesting young man, Mr. Dillon."</p>

<p>When the door closed on her, Edith began to shriek in
hysterical laughter.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE HEART OF HONORA.</h3>


<p>While Edith urged the search for Endicott, the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
world to be horrified by her success enjoyed itself north
and south as the season suggested, and the laws of fashion
permitted. At the beginning of June, Anne settled herself
comfortably for the summer in a roomy farmhouse,
overlooking Lake Champlain and that particular island of
Valcour, which once witnessed the plucky sea-fight and
defeat of dare-devil Arnold. Only Honora accompanied
her, but at the close of the month Louis, the deacon, and
Mrs. Doyle Grahame joined them; and after that the
whole world came at odd times, with quiet to-day and riot
to-morrow. Honora, the center of interest, the storm-center,
as we call it in these days, turned every eye in her
direction with speculative interest. Would she retire to
the convent, or find her vocation in the world? She had
more than fulfilled her father's wish that she remain in
secular life for a year. Almost two years had passed. He
could not reproach her from his grave.</p>

<p>One divine morning she came upon the natural stage
which had been the scene of a heart-drama more bitter to
her than any sorrow. Walking alone in the solemn woods
along the lake shore, the path suddenly ended on a rocky
terrace, unshaded by trees, and directly over the water.
Raspberry bushes made an enclosure there, in the center
of which the stumps of two trees held a rough plank to
make a seat. A stony beach curved inward from this
point, the dark woods rose behind, and the soft waters
made music in the hollows of the rock beneath her feet.
Delightful with the perfume of the forest, the placid
shores of Valcour, sun, and flower, and bird filling eye
and ear with beauty, the sight of the spot chilled her
heart. Here Lord Constantine had offered her his love
and his life the year before. To her it had been a fright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>ful
scene, this strong, handsome, clever man, born to the
highest things of mind, heart, talent and rank, kneeling
before her, pleading with pallid face for her love, ... and
all the rest of it! She would have sunk down with shame
but for his kindness in accepting the situation, and carrying
her through it.</p>

<p>Why his proposal shocked her his lordship could not
see at first. He understood before his mournful interview
and ended. Honora was of that class, to whom marriage
does not present itself as a personal concern. She had the
true feminine interest in the marriage of her friends, and
had vaguely dreamed of her own march to the altar, an
adoring lover, a happy home and household cares.
Happy in the love of a charming mother and a high-hearted
father, she had devoted her youthful days to them
and to music. They stood between her and importunate
lovers, whose intentions she had never divined.</p>

<p>With the years came trouble, the death of the mother,
the earning of her living by her art, the care of her father,
and the work for her native land. Lovers could not pursue
this busy woman, occupied with father and native land,
and daily necessity. The eternal round of travel, conspiracy,
scheming, planning, spending, with its invariable ending
of disappointment and weariness of heart, brought forth
a longing for the peace of rest, routine, satisfied aspirations;
and from a dream the convent became a passion,
longed for as the oasis by the traveler in the sands.</p>

<p>Simple and sincere as light, the hollow pretence of the
world disgusted her. Her temperament was of that unhappy
fiber which sees the end almost as speedily as the
beginning; change and death and satiety treading on the
heels of the noblest enterprise. For her there seemed no
happiness but in the possession of the everlasting, the
unchangeable, the divinely beautiful. Out of these feelings
and her pious habits rose the longing for the convent,
for what seemed to be permanent, fixed, proportioned,
without dust and dirt and ragged edges, and wholly
devoted to God.</p>

<p>After a little Lord Constantine understood her astonishment,
her humiliation, her fright. He had a wretched
satisfaction in knowing that no other man would snatch
this prize; but oh, how bitter to give her up even to God!
The one woman in all time for him, more could be said in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
her praise still; her like was not outside heaven. How
much this splendid lake, with sapphire sky and green
shores, lacked of true beauty until she stepped like light
into view; then, as for the first time, one saw the green
woods glisten, the waters sparkle anew, the sky deepen in
richness! One had to know her heart, her nature, so
nobly dowered, to see this lighting up of nature's finest
work at her coming. She was beautiful, white as milk,
with eyes like jewels, framed in lashes of silken black, so
dark, so dark!</p>

<p>Honora wept at the sight of his face as he went away.
She had seen that despair in her father's face. And she
wept to-day as she sat on the rough bench. Had she
been to blame? Why had she delayed her entrance into
the convent a year beyond the time? Arthur had declared
his work could not get on without her for at least an extra
half year. She was lingering still? Had present comfort
shaken her resolution?</p>

<p>A cry roused her from her mournful thoughts, and she
looked up to see Mona rounding the point at the other
end of the stony beach, laboring at the heavy oars.
Honora smiled and waved her handkerchief. Here was
one woman for whom life had no problems, only solid contentment,
and perennial interest; and who thought her
husband the finest thing in the world. She beached her
boat and found her way up to the top of the rock. To
look at her no one would dream, Honora certainly did
not, that she had any other purpose than breathing the
air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Doyle Grahame enjoyed the conviction that marriage
settles all difficulties, if one goes about it rightly.
She had gone about it rightly, with marvellous results.
That charming bear her father had put his neck in her
yoke, and now traveled about in her interest as mild as a
clam. All men gasped at the sight of his meekness. When
John Everard Grahame arrived on this planet, his grandfather
fell on his knees before him and his parents, and
never afterwards departed from that attitude. Doyle
Grahame laid it to his art of winning a father-in-law.
Mona found the explanation simply in the marriage, which
to her, from the making of the trousseau to the christening
of the boy, had been wonderful enough to have changed the
face of the earth. The delicate face, a trifle fuller, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
increased in dignity. Her hair flamed more glorious than
ever. As a young matron she patronized Honora now an
old maid.</p>

<p>"You've been crying," said she, with a glance around,
"and I don't wonder. This is the place where you broke
a good man's heart. It will remain bewitched until you
accept some other man in the same spot. How did we
know, Miss Cleverly? Do you think Conny was as secret
as you? And didn't I witness the whole scene from the
point yonder? I couldn't hear the words, but there wasn't
any need of it. Heavens, the expression of you two!"</p>

<p>"Mona, do you mean to tell me that every one knew it?"</p>

<p>"Every soul, my dear ostrich with your head in the
sand. The hope is that you will not repeat the refusal
when the next lover comes along. And if you can arrange
to have the scene come off here, as you arranged for the
last one ... I have always maintained that the lady with
a convent vocation is by nature the foxiest of all women.
I don't know why, but she shows it."</p>

<p>The usual fashion of teasing Honora attributed to her
qualities opposed to a religious vocation.</p>

<p>"Well, I have made up my mind to fly at once to the
convent," she said, "with my foxiness and other evil qualities.
If it was my fault that one man proposed to
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was your fault, of course. Why do you throw doubt
upon it?"</p>

<p>"It will not be my fault that the second man proposes.
So, this place may remain accursed forever. Oh, my poor
Lord Constantine! After all his kindness to father and
me, to be forced to inflict such suffering on him! Why
do men care for us poor creatures so much, Mona?"</p>

<p>"Because we care so much for them ..." Honora
laughed ... "and because we are necessary to their
happiness. You should go round the stations on your
knees once a day for the rest of your life, for having rejected
Lord Conny. It wasn't mere ingratitude ... that
was bad enough; but to throw over a career so splendid,
to desert Ireland so outrageously," this was mere pretence
... "to lose all importance in life for the sake of
a dream, for the sake of a convent."</p>

<p>"You have a prejudice against convents, Mona."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I believe in convents for those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
made that way. I have noticed, perhaps you have too,
that many people who should go to a convent will not,
and many people at present in the cloisters ought to have
stayed where nature put them first."</p>

<p>"It's pleasant on a day like this for you to feel that you
are just where nature intended you to be, isn't it? How
did you leave the baby?"</p>

<p>Mona leaped into a rhapsody on the wonderful child,
who was just then filling the time of Anne, and at the
same time filling the air with howlings, but returned
speedily to her purpose.</p>

<p>"Did you say you had fixed the day, Honora?"</p>

<p>"In September, any day before the end of the month."</p>

<p>"You were never made for the convent," with seriousness.
"Too fond of the running about in life, and your
training is all against it."</p>

<p>"My training!" said Honora.</p>

<p>"All your days you were devoted to one man, weren't
you? And to the cause of a nation, weren't you? And
to the applause of the crowd, weren't you? Now, my
dear, when you find it necessary to make a change in your
habits, the changes should be in line with those habits.
Otherwise you may get a jolt that you won't forget. In a
convent, there will be no man, no Ireland, and no crowd,
will there? What you should have done was to marry
Lord Conny, and to keep right on doing what you had
done before, only with more success. Now when the next
man comes along, do not let the grand opportunity go."</p>

<p>"I'll risk the jolt," Honora replied. "But this next
man about whom you have been hinting since you came
up here? Is this the man?"</p>

<p>She pointed to the path leading into the woods. Louis
came towards them in a hurry, having promised them a
trip to the rocks of Valcour. The young deacon was in
fighting trim after a month on the farm, the pallor of hard
study and confinement had fled, and the merry prospect
ahead made his life an enchantment. Only his own could
see the slight but ineffaceable mark of his experience with
Sister Claire.</p>

<p>"Take care," whispered Mona. "He is not the man,
but the man's agent."</p>

<p>Louis bounced into the raspberry enclosure and flung
himself at their feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," said Honora mischievously. "Is there any
man in love with me, and planning to steal away my convent
from me? Tell me true, Louis."</p>

<p>The deacon sat up and cast an indignant look on his
sister.</p>

<p>"Shake not thy gory locks at me," she began cooly....</p>

<p>"There it is," he burst out. "Do you know, Honora,
I think marriage turns certain kinds of people, the redheads
in particular, quite daft. This one is never done
talking about her husband, her baby, her experience, her
theory, her friends who are about to marry, or who want
to marry, or who can't marry. She can't see two persons
together without patching up a union for them...."</p>

<p>"Everybody should get married," said Mona serenely,
"except priests and nuns. Mona is not a nun, therefore
she should get married."</p>

<p>"The reasoning is all right," replied the deacon, "but
it doesn't apply here. Don't you worry, Honora. There's
no man about here that will worry you, and even if there
was, hold fast to that which is given thee...."</p>

<p>"Don't quote Scripture, Reverend Sir," cried Mona
angrily.</p>

<p>"The besotted world is not worth the pother this foolish
young married woman makes over it."</p>

<p>The foolish young woman received a warning from her
brother when Mona went into the woods to gather an armful
of wild blossoms for the boat.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," said he with the positiveness of a
young theologian, "that Arthur will probably never
marry? Has he looked at a girl in that way since he came
back from California? He's giddy enough, I know, but
one that studies him can see he has no intention of marrying.
Now why do you trouble this poor girl, after her
scene with the Englishman, with hints of Arthur? I tell
you he will never marry."</p>

<p>"You may know more about him than I do," his sister
placidly answered, "but I have seen him looking at Honora
for the last five years, and working for her, and thinking
about her. His look changed recently. Perhaps you
know why. There's something in the air. I can feel it.
You can't. None of you celibates can. And you can't
see beyond your books in matters of love and marriage.
That's quite right. We can manage such things better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
And if Arthur makes up his mind to win her, I'm bound
she shall have him."</p>

<p>"We can manage! I'm bound!" he mimicked. "Well,
remember that I warned you. It isn't so much that your
fingers may be burned ... that's what you need, you
married minx. You may do harm to those two. They
seem to be at peace. Let 'em alone."</p>

<p>"What was the baby doing when you left the house?"
said she for answer.</p>

<p>"Tearing the nurse's hair out in handfuls," said the
proud uncle, as he plunged into a list of the doings of the
wonderful child, who fitted into any conversation as neatly
as a preposition.</p>

<p>Mona, grew sad at heart. Her brother evidently knew
of some obstacle to this union, something in Arthur's past
life which made his marriage with any woman impossible.
She recalled his silence about the California episode, his
indifference to women, his lack of enthusiasm as to
marriage.</p>

<p>They rowed away over the lake, with the boat half
buried in wild bushes, sprinkled with dandelion flowers
and the tender blossoms of the apple trees. Honora was
happy, at peace. She put the scene with Lord Constantine
away from her, and forgot the light words of Mona.</p>

<p>Whoever the suitor might be, Arthur did not appear to
her as a lover. So careful had he been in his behavior,
that Louis would have as much place in her thought as
Arthur, who had never discouraged her hope of the convent,
except by pleading for Ireland. The delay in keeping
her own resolution had been pleasant. Now that the
date was fixed, the grateful enclosure of the cloister seemed
to shut her in from all this dust and clamor of men, from the
noisome sights and sounds of world-living, from the endless
coming and going and running about, concerning trifles,
from the injustice and meanness and hopeless crimes of
men.</p>

<p>In the shade of the altar, in the restful gloom of Calvary,
she could look up with untired eyes to the calm glow of
the celestial life, unchanging, orderly, beautiful with its
satisfied aspiration, and rich in perfect love and holy companionship.
Such a longing came over her to walk into
this perfect peace that moment! Mona well knew this
mood, and Louis in triumph signalled his sister to look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Her eyes, turned to the rocky shore of Valcour, saw far
beyond. On her perfect face lay a shadow, the shadow of
her longing, and from her lips came now and then the perfume
of a sigh.</p>

<p>In silence these two watched her, Louis recognizing the
borderland of holy ecstasy, Mona hopeful that the vision
was only a mirage. The boat floated close to the perpendicular
rocks and reflected itself in the deep waters; far
away the farmhouse lay against the green woods; to the
north rose the highest point of the bluff, dark with pines;
farther on was the sweep of the curved shore, and still
farther the red walls of the town. Never boat carried
freight so beautiful as this which bore along the island the
young mother, the young deacon, and deep-hearted
Honora, who was blessing God.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE PAULINE PRIVILEGE.</h3>


<p>For a week at the end of July Arthur had been in the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
closing up the Curran episode. On his return every one
felt that change of marked and mysterious kind had touched
him. His face shone with joy. The brooding shadow,
acquired in his exile, had disappeared. Light played about
his face, emanated from it, as from moonlit water, a phosphorescence
of the daylight. His mother studied him with
anxiety, without which she had not been since the surprising
visit of Curran. The old shadow seemed to have
fled forever.</p>

<p>One night on the lake, as Louis and he floated lazily
towards the island, he told the story. After enjoying a
moonlight swim at the foot of the bluff, they were preparing
to row over to Valcour when Honora's glorious voice
rang out from the farmhouse on the hill above, singing to
Mona's accompaniment. The two sat in delight. A full
moon stood in the sky, and radiance silvered the bosom of
the lake, the mystic shores, the far-off horizon. This
singer was the voice of the night, whose mystic beauty and
voiceless feeling surged into the woman's song like waters
escaping through a ravine. Dillon was utterly oppressed
by happiness. When the song had ceased, he stretched
out his arms towards her.</p>

<p>"Dearest and best of women! By God's grace I shall
soon call you mine!"</p>

<p>Louis took up the oars and pulled with energy in the
direction of Valcour. "Is that the meaning of the look
on your face since your return?" said he.</p>

<p>"That's the meaning. I saw you all watching me in
surprise. My mother told me of it in her anxiety. If my
face matched my feelings the moon there would look sickly
besides its brightness. I have been in jail for five years, and
to-day I am free."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how about that other woman ...?"</p>

<p>"Dead as far as I am concerned, the poor wretch!
Yesterday I could curse her. I pity her to-day. She has
gone her way and I go mine. Monsignor has declared me
free. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"That's enough," cried Louis, dropping the oars in his
excitement. "But is it enough to give you Honora?
I'm so glad you think of her that way. Mona told her
only yesterday that some lover was pursuing her, not mentioning
your name. I assured her on the contrary that
the road to the convent would have no obstacles. And I
rebuked Mona for her interference."</p>

<p>"You were right, and she was right," said Arthur sadly.
"I never dared to show her my love, because I was not
free. But now I shall declare it. What did she think of
Mona's remarks?"</p>

<p>"She took them lightly. I am afraid that your freedom
comes at a poor time, Arthur; that you may be too late.
I have had many talks with her. Her heart is set on the
convent, she has fixed the date for September, and she
does not seem to have love in her mind at all."</p>

<p>"Love begets love. How could she think of love when
I never gave any sign, except what sharp-eyed Mona saw.
You can conceal nothing from a woman. Wait until I
have wooed her ... but apart from all that you must hear
how I came to be free ... oh, my God, I can hardly
believe it even now after three days ... I have been so
happy that the old anguish which tore my soul years ago
seemed easier to bear than this exquisite pain. I must get
used to it. Listen now to the story of my escape, and row
gently while you listen so as to miss not a word."</p>

<p>Arthur did not tell his chum more than half of the tale,
chiefly because Louis was never to know the story of
Horace Endicott. He had gone to New York at the invitation
of Livingstone. This surprising incident began
a series of surprises. The Currans had returned from
California, and made their report to Sonia; and to Livingstone
of all men the wife of Horace Endicott had gone
for advice in so delicate an affair as forcing Arthur Dillon
to prove and defend his identity. After two or three interviews
with Livingstone Arthur carried his report to
Monsignor.</p>

<p>"All this looks to me," said the priest, "as if the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
for a return to your own proper personality had come.
You know how I have feared the consequences of this
scheme. The more I look into it, the more terrible it
seems."</p>

<p>"And why should I give up now of all times? when I
am a success?" cried the young fellow. "Do I fear
Livingstone and the lawyers? Curran and his wife have
done their best, and failed. Will the lawyers do any
better?"</p>

<p>"It is not that," said the priest. "But you will always
be annoyed in this way. The sharks and blackmailers
will get after you later...."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, Monsignor. This effort of the Currans
and Mrs. Endicott will be the last. I won't permit it.
There will be no result from Livingstone's interference.
He can go as far as interviews with me, but not one step
beyond. And I can guarantee that no one will ever take
up the case after him."</p>

<p>"You are not reasonable," urged the priest. "The
very fact that these people suspect you to be Horace Endicott
is enough; it proves that you have been discovered."</p>

<p>"I am only the twentieth whom they pursued for
Horace," he laughed. "Curran knows I am not Endicott.
He has proved to the satisfaction of Livingstone
that I am Arthur Dillon. But the two women are pertinacious,
and urge the men on. Since these are well paid
for their trouble, why should they not keep on?"</p>

<p>"They are not the only pertinacious ones," the priest
replied.</p>

<p>"You may claim a little of the virtue yourself," Arthur
slyly remarked. "You have urged me to betray myself
into the hands of enemies once a month for the last five
years."</p>

<p>"In this case would it not be better to get an advantage
by declaring yourself, before Livingstone can bring
suit against you?"</p>

<p>"There will be no suit," he answered positively. "I
hold the winning cards in this game. There is no advantage
in my returning to a life which for me holds nothing
but horror. Do you not see, Monsignor, that the same
reasons which sent me out of it hold good to keep me out
of it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very true," said Monsignor reluctantly, as he viewed
the situation.</p>

<p>"And new reasons, not to be controverted, have sprung
up around Arthur Dillon. For Horace Endicott there is
nothing in that old life but public disgrace. Do you
know that I hate that fat fool, that wretched cuckold who
had not sense enough to discover what the uninterested
knew about that woman? I would not wear his name,
nor go back to his circle, if the man and woman were
dead, and the secret buried forever."</p>

<p>"He was young and innocent," said the priest with a
pitiful glance at Arthur.</p>

<p>"And selfish and sensual too. I despise him. He
would never have been more than an empty-headed pleasure-seeker.
With that wife he could have become anything
you please. The best thing he did was his flight
into everlasting obscurity, and that he owed to the simple,
upright, strong-hearted woman who nourished him in his
despair. Monsignor," and he laid his firm hand on the
knee of the priest and looked at him with terrible eyes,
"I would choose death rather than go back to what I was.
I shall never go back. I get hot with shame when I think
of the part an Endicott played as Sonia Westfield's fool."</p>

<p>"And the reason not to be controverted?"</p>

<p>"In what a position my departure would leave my
mother. Have you thought of that? After all her kindness,
her real affection, as if I had been her own son.
She thinks now that I am her son, and I feel that she is
my mother. And what would induce me to expose her to
the public gaze as the chief victim, or the chief plotter in
a fraud? If it had to be done, I would wait in any event
until my mother was dead. But beyond all these minor
reasons is one that overshadows everything. I am Arthur
Dillon. That other man is not only dead, he is as unreal
to me as the hero of any book I read in my boyhood. It
was hard to give up the old personality; to give up what
I am now would be impossible. I am what I seem. I
feel, think, speak, dream Arthur Dillon. The roots would
bleed if I were to transplant myself. I found my career
among your people, and the meaning of life. There is no
other career for me. These are the people I love. I will
never raise between them and me so odious a barrier as
the story of my disappearance would be. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
never take to Horace Endicott. Oh, I have given the
matter a moment's thought, Monsignor. The more I
dwell on it, the worse it seems."</p>

<p>He considered the point for a moment, and then whispered
with joyous triumph, "I have succeeded beyond my own
expectations. I have disappeared even from myself. An
enemy cannot find me, not even my own confession would
reveal me. The people who love me would swear to a man
that I am Arthur Dillon, and that only insanity could explain
my own confession. At the very least they would raise
such a doubt in the mind of a judge that he would insist
on clean proofs from both sides. But there's the clear fact.
I have escaped from myself, disappeared from the sight of
Arthur Dillon. Before long I can safely testify to a dream
I had of having once been a wretch named Horace Endicott.
But I have a doubt even now that I was such a man."</p>

<p>"My God, but it's weird," said Monsignor with emotion,
as he rose to walk the room. "I have the same notion
myself at times."</p>

<p>"It's a matter to be left undisturbed, or some one will
go crazy over it," Arthur said seriously.</p>

<p>"And you are happy, really happy? The sight of this
woman did not revive in you any regret...."</p>

<p>"I am happy, Monsignor, beyond belief," with a contented
sigh. "It would be too much to expect perfect
happiness. Yet that is within my reach. If I were only
free to marry Honora Ledwith."</p>

<p>"I heard of that too," said the priest meditatively.
"Has she any regard for you?"</p>

<p>"As a brother. How could I have asked any other
love? And I am rich in that. Since there is no divorce
for Catholics, I could not let her see the love which burned
in me. I had no hope."</p>

<p>"And she goes into the convent, I believe. You must
not stand in God's way."</p>

<p>"I have not, though I delayed her going because I could
not bear to part from her. Willingly I have resigned her
to God, because I know that in His goodness, had I been
free, He would have given her to me."</p>

<p>Monsignor paused as if struck by the thought and
looked at him for a moment.</p>

<p>"It is the right spirit," was his brief comment.</p>

<p>He loved this strange, incomprehensible man, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
stood for five years between his adopted people and their
enemies in many a fight, who had sought battle in their
behalf and heaped them with favors. His eyes saw the
depth of that resignation which gave to God the one jewel
that would have atoned for the horrid sufferings of the
past. If he were free! He thought of old Lear moaning
over dead Cordelia.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">She lives! If it be so,</span><br />
<span class="i0">It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows</span><br />
<span class="i0">That ever I have felt.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"It is the right spirit," he repeated as he considered
the matter. "One must not stand in the way of a soul,
or in the way of God. Yet were you free, where would
be the advantage? She is for the convent, and has never
thought of you in the way of love."</p>

<p>"Love begets love, father dear. I could light the flame
in her heart, for I am dear to her as a brother, as her
father's son."</p>

<p>"Then her dream of the convent, which she has cherished
so many years, cannot be more than a dream, if she
resigned it for you."</p>

<p>"I cannot argue with you," he said hopelessly, "and
it's a sad subject. There is only the will of God to be done."</p>

<p>"And if you were free," went on Monsignor smiling,
"and tried and failed to light love in her heart, you would
suffer still more."</p>

<p>"A little more or less would not matter. I would be
happy still to give her to God."</p>

<p>"I see, I see," shaking his sage head. "To God! As
long as it is not to another and luckier fellow, the resignation
is perfect."</p>

<p>Arthur broke into a laugh, and the priest said casually:</p>

<p>"I think that by the law of the Church you are a free
man."</p>

<p>Arthur leaped to his feet with a face like death.</p>

<p>"In the name of God!" he cried.</p>

<p>Monsignor pushed him back into his chair.</p>

<p>"That's my opinion. Just listen, will you. Then take
your case to a doctor of the law. There is a kind of
divorce in the Church known as the Pauline Privilege.
Let me state the items, and do you examine if you can
claim the privilege. Horatius, an infidel, that is, unbap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>tized,
deserts his wife legally and properly, because of her
crimes; later he becomes a Catholic; meeting a noble
Catholic lady, Honoria, he desires to marry her; question,
is he free to contract this marriage? The answer of the
doctors of the law is in the affirmative, with the following
conditions: that the first wife be an infidel, that is, unbaptized;
that to live with her is impossible; that she has
been notified of his intention to break the marriage. The
two latter conditions are fulfilled in your case the moment
the first wife secures the divorce which enables her to
marry her paramour. Horatius is then free to marry
Honoria, or any other Catholic lady, but not a heretic or a
pagan. This is called the Pauline Privilege because it is
described in the Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians.
My opinion is that you are free."</p>

<p>The man, unable to speak, or move, felt his hope grow
strong and violent out of the priest's words.</p>

<p>"Mind, it's only my opinion," said Monsignor, to
moderate his transports.</p>

<p>"You must go to Dr. Bender, the theologian, to get a
purely legal decision. I fear that I am only adding to
your misery. What if he should decide against you?
What if she should decide against you?"</p>

<p>"Neither will happen," with painful effort. Sudden
joy overcame him with that anguish of the past, and this
was overwhelming, wonderful.</p>

<p>"The essence of love is sacrifice," said Monsignor,
talking to give him time for composure. "Not your
good only, but the happiness of her you love must control
your heart and will; and above all there must be submission
to God. When He calls, the child must leave the
parent, the lover his mistress, all ties must be broken."</p>

<p>"I felt from the beginning that this would come to
pass," said Arthur weakly. "Oh, I made my sacrifice
long ago. The facts were all against me, of course.
Easy to make the sacrifice which had to be made. I can
make another sacrifice, but isn't it now her turn? Oh,
Monsignor, all my joy seems to come through you! From
that first moment years ago, when we met, I can date&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All your sorrow," the priest interrupted.</p>

<p>"And all my joy. Well, one cannot speak of these
great things, only act. I'm going to the theologian.
Before I sleep to-night he must settle that case. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
from your eyes it will be in my favor. I can bear disappointment.
I can bear anything now. I am free from
that creature, she is without a claim on me in any way,
law, fact, religion, sympathy. Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>Monsignor could not hinder the tears that poured from
his eyes silently. He clasped Arthur's hand and saw him go
as he wept. In his varied life he had never seen so intimately
any heart, none so strange and woful in its sorrow and its
history, none so pathetic. The man lived entirely on the
plane of tragedy, in the ecstasy of pain; a mystery, a
problem, a wonder, yet only an average, natural, simple
man, that had fought destiny with strange weapons.</p>

<p>This story Arthur whispered to Louis, floating between
the moonlit shores of Champlain. He lay in the stern
watching the rhythmic rise of the oar-blades, and the flashing
of the water-drops falling back like diamonds into the
wave. Happiness lay beside him steering the boat, a
seraph worked the oars, the land ahead must be paradise.
His was a lover's story, clear, yet broken with phrases of
love; for was he not speaking to the heart, half his own,
that beat with his in unison? The tears flowed down the
deacon's cheek, tears of dread and of sympathy. What
if Honora refused this gift laid so reverently at her feet?
He spoke his dread.</p>

<p>"One must take the chance," said the lover calmly.
"She is free too. I would not have her bound. The
very air up here will conspire with me to win her. She
must learn at once that I want her for my wife. Then let
the leaven work."</p>

<p>The boat came back to the landing. The ladies sat on
the veranda chatting quietly, watching the moon which
rose higher and higher, and threw Valcour into shadow so
deep, that it looked like a great serpent asleep on a crystal
rock, nailed by a golden spike through its head to the
crystal rock beneath. The lighthouse lamp burning
steadily at the south point, and its long reflection in the
still waters, was the golden nail. A puffing tug passed by
with its procession of lumber boats, fanciful with colored
lights, resounding with the roaring songs of the boatmen;
and the waves recorded their protest against it in long
groans on the shore. Arthur drank in the scene without
misgiving, bathed in love as in moonlight. This moon
would see the consummation of his joy.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">LOVE IS BLIND.</h3>


<p>Next morning after breakfast the house began to echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
with the singing of the inmates. Mona sang to the baby
in an upper room, the Deacon thrummed the piano and
hummed to himself in the raucous voice peculiar to most
churchmen. Judy in the kitchen meditatively crooned to
her maids an ancient lamentation, and out on the lawn,
Arthur sang to his mother an amorous ditty in compliment
to her youthful appearance. Honora, the song-bird,
silent, heard with amusement this sudden lifting up of
voices, each unconscious of the other. Arthur's bawling
dominated.</p>

<p>"Has the house gone mad?" she inquired from the
hallway stairs, so clearly that the singers paused to hear.
"What is the meaning of all this uproar of song. Judy
in the kitchen, Mona in the nursery, Louis in the parlor,
Arthur on the lawn?"</p>

<p>The criminals began to laugh at the coincidence.</p>

<p>"I always sing to baby," Mona screamed in justification.</p>

<p>"I wasn't singing, I never sing," Louis yelled from the
parlor.</p>

<p>"Mother drove me to it," Arthur howled through the
door.</p>

<p>"I think the singin' was betther nor the shoutin'," Judy
observed leaning out of the window to display her quizzical
smile.</p>

<p>A new spirit illumined the old farmhouse. Love had
entered it, and hope had followed close on his heels; hope
that Honora would never get to her beloved convent.
They loved her so and him that with all their faith, their
love and respect for the convent life, gladly would they
have seen her turn away from the holy doors into Arthur's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
reverential arms. With the exception of Anne. So surely
had she become his mother that the thought of giving him
up to any woman angered her. She looked coldly on
Honora for having inspired him with a foolish passion.</p>

<p>"Come down, celestial goddess," said Arthur gayly,
"and join the Deacon and me in a walk over the bluff,
through the perfumed woods, down the loud-resounding
shore. Put on rubbers, for the dew has no respect for the
feet of such divinity."</p>

<p>They went off together in high spirits, and Mona came
down to the veranda with the baby in her arms to look
after them. Anne grieved at the sight of their intimacy.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind," she said, "to hurry Honora off to
her convent, or to bring Sister Magdalen and the Mother
Superior up here to strengthen her. If that boy has his
way, he'll marry her before Christmas. He has the look of
it in his eye."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't he?" Mona asked. "If she will
have him, then she has no business with the convent, and
it will be a good opportunity for her to test her vocation."</p>

<p>"And what luck will there be in it for him?" said the
mother bitterly. "How would you feel if some hussy
cheated Louis out of his priesthood, with blue eyes and
golden hair and impudence? If Arthur wants to marry
after waiting so long, let him set eyes on women that ask
for marriage. He'll never have luck tempting a poor girl
from the convent."</p>

<p>"Little ye think o' the luck," said Judy, who had come
out to have her morning word with the mistress. "Weren't
ye goin' into a convent yerself whin Pat Dillon kem along,
an' wid a wink tuk ye to church undher his arm. An' is
there a woman in the whole world that's had greater luck
than yerself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you are all working for the same thing,
all against me," Anne said pettishly.</p>

<p>"Faith we are, and may the angels guide him and
her to each other. Can't a blind man see they wor made
to be man an' wife? An' I say it, knowin' that the convent
is the best place in the world for anny girl. I wish
every girl that was born wint there. If they knew what
is lyin' in wait for thim whin they take up wid a man,
there wouldn't be convents enough to hould all that wud
be runnin' to thim. But ye know as well as I do that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
girls are not med for the convent, except the blessed
few...."</p>

<p>Anne fled from the stream of Judy's eloquence, and the
old lady looked expressively at Mona.</p>

<p>"She's afraid she's goin' to lose her Artie. Oh, these
Irish mothers! they'd kape a boy till his hairs were gray,
an' mek him belave it too, if they cud. I never saw but
wan mother crazy to marry her son. That was Biddy
Brady, that wint to school wid yer mother, an' poor Micksheen
was a born ijit, wid a lip hangin' like a sign, so's ye
cud hang an auction notice on it. Sure, the poor boy
wudn't lave his mother for Vanus herself, an' the mother
batin' him out o' the house every day, an' he bawlin' for
fear the women wud get hould of him."</p>

<p>Honora had observed the happy change in Arthur, her
knight of service, who had stood between her and danger,
and had fought her battles with chivalry; asking no reward,
hinting at none, because she had already given him
all, a sister's love. What tenderness, what adoration,
what service had he lavished on her, unmarred by act, or
word, or hint! God would surely reward him for his consideration.
Walking through the scented woods she
found it easy to tell them of the date fixed for her entrance
into the convent. Grand trees were marshalled
along the path, supporting a roof of gold and green,
where the sun fell strong on the heavy foliage.</p>

<p>"September," said Arthur making a calculation.
"Why not wait until October and then shed your colors
with the trees. I can see her," he went on humorously,
"decorously arranging the black dress so that it will hang
well, and not make her a fright altogether before the
other women; and getting a right tilt to the black bonnet
and enough lace in it to set off her complexion."</p>

<p>"Six months later," said the Deacon taking up the
strain, "she will do better than that. Discarding the
plain robes of the postulant, she will get herself into the
robes of a bride...."</p>

<p>"Oh, sooner than that," said Arthur with a meaning
which escaped her.</p>

<p>"No, six months is the period," she corrected seriously.</p>

<p>"In wedding finery she will prance before her delighted
friends for a few minutes, and then march out to shed
white silk and fleecy tulle. A vengeful nun, whose hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
has long been worn away, will then clip with one snip of
the scissors her brown locks from her head...."</p>

<p>"Horror!" cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"Sure, straight across the neck, you know, like the
women's-rights people. Then the murder of the hair has
to be concealed, so they put on a nightcap, and hide that
with a veil, and then bring her into the bishop to tell
him it's all right, and that she's satisfied."</p>

<p>"And what do they make of the hair?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"That's one of the things yet to be revealed."</p>

<p>"And after that she is set at chasing the rule, or being
chased by the rule for two years. She studies striking examples
of observing the rule, and of the contrary. She
has a shy at observing it herself, and the contrary. The
rule is it when she observes it; she's it when she doesn't.
At this point the mother superior comes into the game."</p>

<p>"Where do the frowsy children come in?"</p>

<p>"At meals usually. Honora cuts the bread and her
fingers, butters it, and passes it round; the frowsy butter
themselves, and Honora; this is an act of mortification,
which is intensified when the mistress of novices discovers
the butter on her habit."</p>

<p>"Finally the last stage is worse than the first, I suppose.
Having acquired the habit she gets into it so deeply...."</p>

<p>"She sheds it once more, Arthur. Then she's tied to
the frowsy children forever, and is known as Sister Mary
of the Cold Shoulder to the world."</p>

<p>"This is a case of rescue," said Arthur with determination,
"I move we rescue her this minute. Help, help!"</p>

<p>The woods echoed with his mocking cries. Honora had
not spoken, the smile had died away, and she was plainly
offended. Louis observant passed a hint to Arthur, who
made the apology.</p>

<p>"We shall be there," he said humbly, "with our hearts
bleeding because we must surrender you. And who are
we that you need care? It is poor Ireland that will mourn
for the child that bathed and bound her wounds, that
watched by her in the dark night, and kept the lamp of
hope and comfort burning, that stirred hearts to pity and
service, that woke up Lord Constantine and me, and
strangers and enemies like us, to render service; the
child whose face and voice and word and song made the
meanest listen to a story of injustice; all shut out, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>cealed,
put away where the mother may never see or hear
her more."</p>

<p>His voice broke, his eyes filled with tears at the vividness
of the vision called up in the heart of the woods; and
he walked ahead to conceal his emotion. Honora stopped
dead and looked inquiringly at the Deacon, who switched
the flowers with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of it, Louis?"</p>

<p>He knew not how to make answer, thinking that Arthur
should be the first to tell his story.</p>

<p>"Do you think that we can let you go easily?" he said.
"If we tease you as we did just now it is to hide what we
really suffer. His feeling got the better of him, I think."</p>

<p>The explanation sounded harmless. For an instant a
horrid fear that these woods must witness another scene
like Lord Constantine's chilled her heart. She comforted
Arthur like a sister.</p>

<p>"Do not feel my going too deeply. Change must come.
Let us be glad it is not death, or a journey into distant
lands with no return. I shall be among you still, and
meanwhile God will surely comfort you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could walk straight on like this," Arthur
answered, "through the blessed, free, scented forest, just
as we are, forever! And walking on for years, content
with one another, you, Louis, and I, come out at last, as
we shall soon come out here on the lake, on the shore of
eternity, just as life's sun sets, and the moon of the immortal
life rises; and then without change, or the anguish
of separation and dying, if we could pass over the waters,
and enter the land of eternity, taking our place with God
and His children, our friends, that have been there so
long!"</p>

<p>"Is not that just what we are to do, not after your
fashion, but after the will of God, Arthur? Louis at the
altar, I in the convent before the altar, and you in the
field of battle fighting for us both. Aaron, Miriam,
Moses, here are the three in the woods of Champlain, as
once in the desert of Arabia," and she smiled at the young
men.</p>

<p>Louis returned the smile, and Arthur gave her a look of
adoration, so tender, so bold, that she trembled. The
next moment, when the broad space through which they
were walking ended in a berry-patch, he plunged among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the bushes with eagerness, to gather for her black raspberries
in his drinking-cup. Her attempt to discuss her
departure amiably had failed.</p>

<p>"I am tired already," said she to Louis helplessly. "I
shall go back to the house, and leave you to go on together."</p>

<p>"Don't blame him," the Deacon pleaded, perceiving
how useless was concealment. "If you knew how that
man has suffered in his life, and how you opened heaven
to him ..." she made a gesture of pain ... "remember
all his goodness and be gentle with him. He must speak
before you go. He will take anything from you, and you
alone can teach him patience and submission."</p>

<p>"How long...." she began. He divined what she
would have asked.</p>

<p>"Mona has known it more than a year, but no one else,
for he gave no sign. I know it only a short time. After
all it is not to be wondered at. He has been near you,
working with you for years. His life has been lonely
somehow, and you seemed to fill it. Do not be hasty with
him. Let him come to his avowal and his refusal in his
own way. It is all you can do for him. Knowing you
so well he probably knows what he has to receive."</p>

<p>Arthur came back with his berries and poured them out
on a leaf for her to eat. Seated for a little on a rock,
while he lay on the ground at her feet, she ate to please
him; but her soul in terror saw only the white face of
Lord Constantine, and thought only of the pain in store
for this most faithful friend. Oh, to have it out with him
that moment! Yet it seemed too cruel. But how go on
for a month in dread of what was to come?</p>

<p>She loved him in her own beautiful way. Her tears fell
that night as she sat in her room by the window watching
the high moon, deep crimson, rising through the mist over
the far-off islands. How bitter to leave her beloved even
for God, when the leaving brought woe to them! So
long she had waited for the hour of freedom, and always
a tangle at the supreme moment! How could she be
happy and he suffering without the convent gates? This
pity was to be the last temptation, her greatest trial. Its
great strength did not disarm her. If twenty broke their
hearts on that day, she would not give up her loved design.
Let God comfort them, since she could not. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
vision of a peaceful entrance into the convent faded.
She would have to enter, as she had passed through life,
carrying the burden of another's woe, in tears.</p>

<p>She could see that he never lost heart. The days passed
delightfully, and somehow his adoration pleased her.
Having known him in many lights, there was novelty in
seeing him illumined by candid love. How could he keep
so high a courage with the end so dark and so near?
Honora had no experience of love, romantic love, and she
had always smiled at its expression in the novels of the
time. If Arthur only knew the task he had set for himself!
She loved him truly, but marriage repelled her
almost, except in others.</p>

<p>Therefore, having endured the uncertainty of the position
a week, she had it out with Arthur. Sitting on the
rocks of an ancient quarry, high above the surface of the
lake, they watched the waters rough and white from the
strong south wind. The household had adjourned that
day for lunch to this wild spot, and the members were
scattered about, leaving them, as they always did now, by
common consent alone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said calmly, "this would be a good
time to talk to you, Arthur, as sister to brother ... can't
we talk as brother and sister?"</p>

<p>For a change came over his face that sickened her. The
next moment he was ready for the struggle.</p>

<p>"I fear not, Honora," said he humbly. "I fear we can
never do that again."</p>

<p>"Then you are to stand in my way too?" with bitterness.</p>

<p>"No, but I am not going to stand in my own way," he
replied boldly. "Have I ever stood in your way,
Honora?"</p>

<p>"You have always helped me. Do not fail me at the
last, I beg of you."</p>

<p>"I shall never fail you, nor stand in your way. You
are free now as your father wished you to be. You shall
go to the convent on the date which you have named.
Neither Ireland, nor anything but your heart shall hinder
you. You have seen my heart for a week as you never
saw it before. Do not let what you saw disturb or detain
you. I told your father of it the last day of his life, and
he was glad. He said it was like ... he was satisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Both he and I were of one mind that you should be free.
And you are."</p>

<p>Ideas and words fled from her. The situation of her
own making she knew not how to manage. What could
be more sensible than his speech?</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you," she said helplessly.</p>

<p>He had perfect control of himself, but his attitude expressed
his uneasiness, his face only just concealed his
pain. All his life in moments like this, Arthur Dillon
would suffer from his earliest sorrow.</p>

<p>"I hope you will all let me go with resignation," she
began again.</p>

<p>"I give you to God freely," was his astonishing answer,
"but I may tell you it is my hope He will give you back
to me. I have nothing, and He is the Lord of all. He
has permitted my heart to be turned to ashes, and yet gave
it life again through you. I have confidence in Him.
To you I am nothing; in the future I shall be only a
memory to be prayed for. If we had not God to lift us
up, and repay us for our suffering, to what would we
come? I could not make my heart clear to you, show you
its depths of feeling, frightful depths, I think sometimes,
and secure your pity. God alone, the master of hearts,
can do that. I have been generous to the last farthing.
He will not be outdone by me."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" she murmured, looking at him in
wonder, for his words sounded insanely to her ear.</p>

<p>"I love you, Honora," he went on, with a flush on his
cheek, and so humble that he kept his eyes on the ground.
"Go, in spite of that, if God demands it. If you can,
knowing that I shall be alone, how much alone no one may
know, go nevertheless. Only bear it in mind, that I shall
wait for you outside the convent gate. If you cannot remain
thinking of me, I shall be ready for you. If not
here, then hereafter, as God wills. But you are free, and
I love you. Before you go, God's beloved," and he looked
at her then with eyes so beautiful that her heart went out
to him, "you must let me tell you what I have been. You
will pray for me better, when you have learned how far a
man can sink into hell, and yet by God's grace reach
heaven again."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">A HARPY AT THE FEAST.</h3>


<p>Honora now saw that suffering was not to be avoided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Experience had taught her how to economize with it. In
the wood one day she watched for minutes two robins
hopping about in harmony, feeding, singing now and then
low notes of content from a bough, and always together.
A third robin made appearance on the scene, and their
content vanished. Irritated and uneasy, even angered,
they dashed at the intruder, who stood his ground, confident
of his strength. For a long time he fought them,
leaving only at his own pleasure. Longer still the pair
remained unquiet, distressed by the struggle rather than
wearied, complaining to each other tenderly.</p>

<p>Behold a picture of her own mind, its order upset by the
entrance of a new idea. That life of the mind, which is our
true life, had to change its point of view in order to meet
and cope with the newcomer. Arthur's love had the fiber
of tragedy. She felt rather than knew its nature. For
years it had been growing in his strong heart, disciplined
by steady buffeting, by her indifference, by his own hard
circumstances; no passion of an hour like Romeo's; more
like her father's love for Erin.</p>

<p>Former ideas began to shift position, and to struggle
against the intruder vainly. Some fought in his favor.
The vision of convent peace grew dim. She must take it
with tears, and his sorrow would cloud its beauty. Marriage,
always so remote from her life, came near, and tried
to prove the lightness of its yoke with Arthur as the mate.
The passion of her father's life awoke. Dear Erin cried
out to her for the help which such a union would bring.</p>

<p>Her fixed resolve to depart for her convent in September
kept the process from tangle. Sweet indeed was the
thought of how nobly he loved her. She was free. God
alone was the arbiter. None would hinder her going, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
her heart did not bid her stay for his sake. Her father
had needed her. She would never have forgiven herself
had she left him to carry his sorrow alone. Perhaps this
poor soul needed her more. With delight one moment
and shame the next, she saw herself drifting towards him.
Nevertheless she did not waver, nor change the date of
her departure.</p>

<p>Arthur continued to adore at her shrine as he had done
for years, and she studied him with the one thought: how
will he bear new sorrow? No man bore the mark of
sorrow more terribly when he let himself go, and at times
his mask fell off in spite of resolve. As a lover Honora,
with all her distaste for marriage, found him more lovable
than ever, and had to admit that companionship with her
hero would not be irritating. The conspiracy in his favor
flourished within and without the citadel. Knowing that
he adored her, she liked the adoration. To any goddess
the smell of the incense is sweet, the sight of the flowers,
the humid eyes, the leaping heart delightful. Yet she put
it one side when the day over, and she knelt in her room
for prayer. Like a dream the meanings of the day faded,
and the vision of her convent cell, its long desired peace
and rest, returned with fresher coloring. The men and
women of her little world, the passions and interests of
the daylight, so faded, that they seemed to belong to
another age.</p>

<p>While this comedy went on the farmhouse and its happy
life were keenly and bitterly watched by the wretched
wife of Curran. It was her luck, like Sonia's, to spoil
her own feast in defiling her enemy's banquet. Having
been routed at all points and all but sent to Jezebel's fate
by Arthur Dillon, she had stolen into this paradise to do
what mischief she could. Thus it happened, at the
moment most favorable for Arthur's hopes, when Honora
inclined towards him out of sisterly love and pity, that
the two women met in a favorite haunt of Honora's, in
the woods near the lake shore.</p>

<p>To reach it one took a wild path through the woods,
over the bluff, and along the foot of the hill, coming out
on a small plateau some fifteen feet above the lake. Behind
rose a rocky wall, covered with slender pines and
cedars; noble trees shaded the plateau, leaving a clearing
towards the lake; so that one looked out as from a frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of foliage on the blue waters, the islet of St. Michel, and
the wooded cape known as Cumberland Head.</p>

<p>As Honora entered this lovely place, Edith sat on a stone
near the edge of the precipice, enjoying the view. She
faced the newcomer with unfailing impertinence, and
coolly studied the woman whom Arthur Dillon loved.
Sickness of heart filled her with rage. The evil beauty of
Sonia and herself showed purely animal beside the pale
spiritual luster that shone from this noble, sad-hearted
maid. Honora bowed distantly and passed on. Edith
began to glow with delight of torturing her presently, and
would not speak lest her pleasure be hurried. The instinct
of the wild beast, to worry the living game, overpowered
her. What business had Honora with so much
luck? The love of Arthur, fame as a singer, beauty, and
a passion for the perfect life? God had endowed herself
with three of these gifts. Having dragged them through
the mud, she hated the woman who had used them with
honor. What delight that in a moment she could torture
her with death's anguish!</p>

<p>"I came here in the hope of meeting you, madam," she
began suddenly, "if you are Miss Ledwith. I come to
warn you."</p>

<p>"I do not need warnings from strangers," Honora replied
easily, studying the other for an instant with indifferent
eyes, "and if you wished me to see on proper matters
you should have called at the house."</p>

<p>"For a scene with the man who ran away from his wife
before he deceived me, and then made love to you? I
could hardly do that," said she as demure and soft as a
purring cat.</p>

<p>Honora's calm look plainly spoke her thought: the creature
was mad.</p>

<p>"I am not mad. Miss Ledwith, and your looks will not
prevent me warning you. Arthur Dillon is not the man
he pretends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please go away," Honora interrupted.</p>

<p>"He is not the son of Anne Dillon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I shall go," said Honora, but Edith barred the
only way out of the place, her eyes blazing with the insane
pleasure of torturing the innocent. Honora turned her
back on her and walked down to the edge of the cliff,
where she remained until the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know Arthur Dillon better than you know him,"
Edith went on, "and I know you better than you think.
Once I had the honor of your acquaintance. That doesn't
matter. Neither does it matter just who Arthur Dillon
is. He's a fraud from cover to cover. His deserted wife
is living, poor as well as neglected. The wretched woman
has sought him long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you put her on the track?" Honora asked,
relieved that the lunatic wished only to talk.</p>

<p>"He makes love to you now as he has done for years,
and he hopes to marry you soon. I can tell that by
his behavior. I warn you that he is not free to marry.
His wife lives. If you marry him I shall put her on his
track, and give you a honeymoon of scandal. It was
enough for him to have wrecked my life and broken my
heart. I shall not permit him to repeat that work on any
other unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>Edith, wholly astonished at the feeble impression made
by her story, saw that her usual form had been lacking.
Her scorn for Honora suggested that acting would be
wasted on her; that the mere news of the living wife
would be sufficient to plunge her into anguish. But here
was no delight of pallid face and trembling limbs. Her
tale would have gone just as well with the trees.</p>

<p>"I have risked my life to tell you this," said she
throwing in the note of pathos. "If Arthur Dillon, or
whoever he is, hears of it, he will kill me."</p>

<p>"Don't worry then," and Honora turned about with
benign face and manner, quite suited to the need of a
crazy patient escaped from her keepers, "I shall never
tell him. But please go, for some one is coming. It may
be he."</p>

<p>Edith turned about swiftly and saw a form approaching
through the trees. She had her choice of two paths
a little beyond, and fled by the upper one. Her fear of
Arthur had become mortal. As it was she rushed into
the arms of Louis, who had seen the fleeing form, and
thought to play a joke upon Mona or Honora. He
dropped the stranger and made apologies for his rudeness.
She curtsied mockingly, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Possibly we have met before."</p>

<p>The blood rose hot to his face as he recognized her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and her face paled as he seized her by the wrist with scant
courtesy.</p>

<p>"I scarcely hoped for the honor of meeting you again,
Sister Claire. Of course you are here only for mischief,
and Arthur Dillon must see you and settle with you. I'll
trouble you to come with me."</p>

<p>"You have not improved," she snarled. "You would
attack my honor again."</p>

<p>Then she screamed for help once, not the second
time, which might have brought Arthur to the scene; but
Honora came running to her assistance.</p>

<p>"Ah, this was your prey, wolf?" said Louis coolly.
"Honora, has she been lying to you, this fox, Sister
Claire, Edith Conyngham, with a string of other names
not to be remembered? Didn't you know her?"</p>

<p>Honora recoiled. Edith stood in shame, with the
mortified expression of the wild beast, the intelligent fox,
trapped by an inferior boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, let her go, Louis," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Not till she has seen Arthur. The mischief she can
do is beyond counting. Arthur knows how to deal with
her."</p>

<p>"I insist," said Honora. "Come away, Louis, please,
come away."</p>

<p>He flung away her wrist with contempt, and pointed
out her path. In a short time she had disappeared.</p>

<p>"And what had she to tell you, may I ask?" said the
Deacon. "Like the banshee her appearance brings misfortune
to us."</p>

<p>"You have always been my confidant, Louis," she
answered after some thought. "Do you know anything
about the earlier years of Arthur Dillon?"</p>

<p>"Much. Was that her theme?"</p>

<p>"That he was married and his wife still lives."</p>

<p>"He will tell you about that business himself no doubt.
I know nothing clear or certain ... some hasty expressions
of feeling ... part of a dream ... the declaration
that all was well now ... and so on. But I shall tell
him. Don't object, I must. The woman is persistent
and diabolical in her attempts to injure us. He must
know at least that she is in the vicinity. He will guess
what she's after without any further hint. But you
mustn't credit her, Honora. As you know...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she answered with a smile. "The
wretched creature is not to be believed under any circumstances.
Poor soul!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless she felt the truth of Edith's story. It
mattered little whether Arthur was Anne Dillon's son,
he would always be the faithful, strong friend, and benefactor.
That he had a wife living, the living witness of
the weakness of his career in the mines, shocked her for
the moment. The fact carried comfort too. Doubt fled,
and the weighing of inclinations, the process kept up by
her mind apart from her will, ceased of a sudden. The
great pity for Arthur, which had welled up in her heart
like a new spring, dried up at its source. For the first
time she felt the sin in him, the absence of the ideal. He
had tripped and fallen like all his kind in the wild days
of youth; and according to his nature had been repeating
with her the drama enacted with his first love. She respected
his first love. She respected the method of
nature, but did not feel forced to admire it.</p>

<p>Her distaste for the intimacy of marriage returned with
tenfold strength. One might have become submissive
and companionable with a virgin nature; to marry another
woman's lover seemed ridiculous. This storm cleared the
air beautifully. Her own point of view became plainer, and
she saw how far inclination had hurried her. For some
hours she had been near to falling in love with Arthur,
had been willing to yield to tender persuasion. The
woman guilty of such weakness did not seem at this moment
to have been Honora Ledwith; only a poor soul,
like a little ship in a big wind, borne away by the tempest
of emotion.</p>

<p>She had no blame for Arthur. His life was his own
concern. Part of it had brought her much happiness.
Edith's scandalous story did not shake her confidence in
him. Undoubtedly he was free to marry, or he would not
have approached her. His freedom from a terrible bond
must have been recent, since his manner towards herself
had changed only that summer, within the month in fact.
The reserve of years had been prompted by hard conditions.
In honor he could not woo. Ah, in him ran the fibre of
the hero, no matter what might have been his mistakes!
He had resisted every natural temptation to show his love.
Once more they were brother and sister, children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
dear father whose last moments they had consoled. Who
would regret the sorrow which led to such a revealing of
hearts?</p>

<p>The vision of her convent rose again to her pleased
eye, fresh and beautiful as of old, and dearer because of
the passing darkness which had concealed it for a time;
the light from the chapel windows falling upon the dark
robes in the choir, the voices of the reader, chanter, and
singer, and the solemn music of the organ; the procession
filing silently from one duty to another, the quiet cell
when the day was over, and the gracious intimacy with
God night and day. Could her belief and her delight in
that holy life have been dim for an instant? Ah, weakness
of the heart! The mountain is none the less firm
because clouds obscure its lofty form. She had been
wrapped in the clouds of feeling, but never once had her
determination failed.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">SONIA CONSULTS LIVINGSTONE.</h3>


<p>Edith's visit, so futile, so unlike her, had been prompted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
by the hatefulness of her nature. The expedition to
California had failed, her effort to prove her instincts true
had come to nothing, and Arthur Dillon had at last put
his foot down and extinguished her and Sonia together.
Free to snarl and spit if they chose, the two cats could
never plot seriously against him more. Curran triumphed
in the end. Tracking Arthur Dillon through California
had all the features of a chase through the clouds after a
bird. The scene changed with every step, and the ground
just gone over faded like a dream.</p>

<p>They found Dillons, a few named Arthur, some coincidences,
several mysteries, and nothing beyond. The police
still had the photographs sent out by Anne Dillon, and a
record that the man sought for had been found and returned
to his mother. The town where the search ended
had only a ruined tavern and one inhabitant, who vaguely
remembered the close of the incident. Edith surrendered
the search in a violent temper, and all but scratched out
the eyes of her devoted slave. To Sonia the detective put
the net result very sensibly.</p>

<p>"Arthur Dillon did not live in California under his own
name," said he, "and things have so changed there in
five years that his tracks have been wiped out as if by
rain. All that has been done so far proves this man to be
just what he appears. We never had a worse case, and
never took up a more foolish pursuit. We have proved
just one sure thing: that if this man be Horace, then he
can't be found. He is too clever to be caught, until he is
willing to reveal himself. If you pursue him to the point
which might result in his capture, there'll be murder or
worse waiting for you at that point. It might be better
for you two not to find him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>This suggestion, clever and terrifying, Sonia could not
understand as clearly as Curran. She thought the soft
nature of Horace quite manageable, and if murder were to
be done her knife should do it. Oh, to seize his throat
with her beautiful hands, to press and squeeze and dig
until the blood gorged his face, and to see him die by
inches, gasping! He had lied like a coward! Nothing
easier to destroy than such a wretch!</p>

<p>"Don't give up, Sonia," was Edith's comment on the
wise words of Curran. "Get a good lawyer, and by some
trick drag Dillon and his mother and the priest to court,
put them on oath as to who the man is; they won't perjure
themselves, I'll wager."</p>

<p>"That is my thought," said Sonia tenderly nursing the
idea. "There seems to be nothing more to do. I have
thought the matter over very carefully. We are at the
end. If this fails I mean to abandon the matter. But
for his money I would have let him go as far as he wanted,
and I would let this man pass too but for the hope of getting
at his money. It is the only way to punish Horace,
as he punished me. I feel like you, that the mystery is
with this Arthur Dillon. Since I saw you last, he has
filled my dreams, and always in the dreams he has been so
like Horace that I now see more of a likeness in Arthur
Dillon. I have a relative in the city, a very successful
lawyer, Quincy Livingstone. I shall consult him. Perhaps
it would be well for you to accompany me, Edith.
You explain this case so well."</p>

<p>"No, she'll keep out of it, by your leave," the detective
answered for her. "Dillon has had patience with this
woman, but he will resent interference so annoying."</p>

<p>Edith made a face at him.</p>

<p>"As if I could be bossed by either you or Arthur.
Sonia, you have the right stuff in you, clear grit. This
trick will land your man."</p>

<p>"You'll find an alligator who will eat the legs off you
both before you can run away," said Curran.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think, Dick Curran?" she
snapped at him. "That you have been playing the traitor
to us, telling Arthur Dillon all we've been doing. Oh,
if I could prove that, you wretch!"</p>

<p>"You have a high opinion of his softness, if you think
he would throw away money to learn what any schoolboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
might learn by himself. How much did you, with all your
cleverness, get out of him in the last five years?"</p>

<p>He laughed joyfully at her wicked face.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you this," he added. "You have been
teasing that boy as a monkey might a lion. Now you
will set on him the man that he likes least in this world,
Livingstone. What a pretty mouthful you will be when
he makes up his mind that you've done enough."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the two women called on Livingstone.
The great man, no longer great, no longer in the eye of
the world, out of politics because the charmed circle had
closed, and no more named for high places because his record
had made him impossible, had returned to the practice of
law. Eminent by his ability, his achievement, and his blood,
but only a private citizen, the shadow of his failure lay
heavy on his life and showed clearly in his handsome face.
That noble position which he had missed, so dear to heart
and imagination, haunted his moments of leisure and
mocked his dreams. He had borne the disappointment
bravely, had lightly called it the luck of politics. Now
that the past lay in clear perspective, he recognized his
own madness.</p>

<p>He had fought with destiny like a fool, had stood in the
path of a people to whom God had given the chance which
the rulers of the earth denied them; and this people,
through a youth carrying the sling of David, had ruined
him. He had no feeling against Birmingham, nor against
Arthur Dillon. The torrent, not the men, had destroyed
him. Yet he had learned nothing. With a fair
chance he would have built another dam the next morning.
He was out of the race forever. In the English mission he
had touched the highest mark of his success. He mourned
in quiet. Life had still enough for him, but oh! the
keenness of his regret.</p>

<p>Sonia's story he had heard before, at the beginning of the
search, as a member of the Endicott family. The details
had never reached him. The cause of Horace Endicott's
flight he had forgotten. Edith in her present costume
remained unknown, nor did she enlighten him. Her
thought as she studied him was of Dillon's luck in his
enterprises. Behold three of his victims. Sonia repeated
for the lawyer the story of her husband's disappearance,
and of the efforts to find him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last I think that I have found him," was her conclusion,
"in the person of a man known in this city as
Arthur Dillon."</p>

<p>Livingstone started slightly. However, there must be
many Arthur Dillons, the Irish being so numerous, and
tasteless in the matter of names. When she described her
particular Arthur his astonishment became boundless at
the absurdity of the supposition.</p>

<p>"You have fair evidence I suppose that he is Horace
Endicott, madam?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to tell you that I have none, because the
statement makes one feel so foolish. On the contrary the
search of a clever detective ... he's really clever, isn't
he, Edith?... shows that Dillon is just what he appears
to be, the son of Mrs. Anne Dillon. The whole town
believes he is her son. The people who knew him since
he was born declare him to be the very image of his
father. Still, I think that he is Horace Endicott. Why
I think so, ... Edith, my dear, it is your turn now.
Do explain to the lawyer."</p>

<p>Livingstone wondered as the dancer spoke where that
beautiful voice and fluent English had become familiar.
Sister Claire had passed from his mind with all the minor
episodes of his political intrigues. He could not find her
place in his memory. Her story won him against his
judgment. The case, well put, found strength in the
contention that the last move had not been made, since the
three most important characters in the play had not been
put to the question.</p>

<p>His mind ran over the chief incidents in that remarkable
fight which Arthur Dillon had waged in behalf of his
people: the interview before the election of Birmingham,
... the intrigues in London, the dexterous maneuvers which
had wrecked the campaign against the Irish, had silenced
McMeeter, stunned the Bishop, banished Fritters, ruined
Sister Claire, tumbled him from his lofty position, and
cut off his shining future. How frightful the thought
that this wide ruin might have been wrought by an Endicott,
one of his own blood!</p>

<p>"A woman's instincts are admirable," he said, politely
and gravely, "and they have led you admirably in this
case. But in face of three facts, the failure of the detective,
the declaration of Mr. Dillon, and your failure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
recognize your husband after five years, it would be absurd
to persist in the belief that this young man is your husband.
Moreover there are intrinsic difficulties, which
would tell even if you had made out a good case for the
theory. No Endicott would take up intimate connection
with the Irish. He would not know enough about them,
he could not endure them; his essence would make the
scheme, even if it were presented to him by others, impossible.
One has only to think of two or three main difficulties
to feel and see the utter absurdity of the whole thing,"</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Sonia sweetly. "Yet I am determined
not to miss this last opportunity to find my husband.
If it fails I shall get my divorce, and ... bother with
the matter no more."</p>

<p>Edith smiled faintly at the suggestive pause, and murmured
the intended phrase, "marry Quincy Lenox."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the lawyer. "You have only to begin
divorce proceedings here, issue a summons for the real
Horace Endicott, and serve the papers on Mr. Arthur
Dillon. You must be prepared for many events however.
The whole business will be ventilated in the journals.
The disappearance will come up again, and be described
in the light of this new sensation. Mr. Dillon is eminent
among his people, and well known in this city. It will be
a year's wonder to have him sued in a divorce case, to
have it made known that he is supposed to be Horace
Endicott."</p>

<p>"That is unavoidable," Edith prompted, seeing a sudden
shrinking on the part of Sonia. "Do not forget, sir, that
all Mrs. Endicott wants is the sworn declaration of Arthur
Dillon that he is not Horace Endicott, of his mother that
he is her son, of Father O'Donnell that he knows nothing
of Horace Endicott since his disappearance."</p>

<p>"You would not like the case to come to trial?" said
the lawyer to Sonia.</p>

<p>"I must get my divorce," she answered coolly, "whether
this is the right man or no."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you what may happen after the summons,
or notice, is served on Mr. Dillon," said the lawyer. "The
serving can be done so quietly that for some time no others
but those concerned need know about it. I shall assume
that Mr. Dillon is not Horace Endicott. In that case he
can ignore the summons, which is not for him, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
another man. He need never appear. If you insisted on
his appearance, you would have to offer some evidence that
he is really Horace Endicott. This you cannot do. He
could make affidavit that he is not the man. By that
time the matter would be public property, and he could
strike back at you for the scandal, the annoyance, and the
damage done to his good name."</p>

<p>"What I want is to have his declaration under oath that
he is not Horace. If he is Horace he will never swear to
anything but the truth."</p>

<p>For the first time Sonia showed emotion, tears dropped
from her lovely eyes, and the lawyer wondered what folly
had lost to her husband so sweet a creature. Evidently
she admired one of Horace's good qualities.</p>

<p>"You can get the declaration in that way. To please
you, he might at my request make affidavit without publicity
and scenes at court."</p>

<p>"I would prefer the court," said Sonia firmly.</p>

<p>"She's afeared the lawyer suspects her virtue," Edith
said to herself.</p>

<p>"Let me now assume that Arthur Dillon is really
Horace Endicott," continued Livingstone. "He must be
a consummate actor to play his part so well and so long.
He can play the part in this matter also, by ignoring the
summons, and declaring simply that he is not the man.
In that case he leaves himself open to punishment, for if
he should thereafter be proved to be Horace Endicott, the
court could punish him for contempt. Or, he can answer
the summons by his lawyer, denying the fact, and stating
his readiness to swear that he is not any other than Arthur
Dillon. You would then have to prove that he is Horace
Endicott, which you cannot do."</p>

<p>"All I want is the declaration under oath," Sonia
repeated.</p>

<p>"And you are ready for any ill consequences, the resentment
and suit of Mr. Dillon, for instance? Understand,
my dear lady, that suit for divorce is not a trifling matter
for Mr. Dillon, if he is not Endicott."</p>

<p>"Particularly as he is about to marry a very handsome
woman," Edith interjected, heedless of the withering
glance from Sonia.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Then I think some way ought to be planned to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Anne Dillon and the priest into court," Edith suggested.
"Under oath they might give us some hint of the way to
find Horace Endicott. The priest knows something about
him."</p>

<p>"I shall be satisfied if Arthur Dillon swears that he is
not Horace," Sonia said, "and then I shall get my divorce
and wash my hands of the tiresome case. It has cost me
too much money and worry."</p>

<p>"Was there any reason alleged for the remarkable disappearance
of the young man? I knew his father and
mother very well, and admired them. I saw the boy in his
schooldays, never afterwards. You have a child, I understand."</p>

<p>Edith lowered her eyes and looked out of the window on
the busy street.</p>

<p>"It is for my child's sake that I have kept up the
search," Sonia answered with maternal tenderness. "Insanity
is supposed to be the cause. Horace acted strangely
for three months before his disappearance, he grew quite
thin, and was absent most of the time. As it was summer,
which I spent at the shore with friends, I hardly noticed
his condition. It was only when he had gone, without
warning, taking considerable money with him, that I
recalled his queer behavior. Since then not a scrap of
information, not a trace, nor a hint of him, has ever come
back to me. The detectives did their best until this
moment. All has failed."</p>

<p>"Very sad," Livingstone said, touched by the hopeless
tone. "Well, as you wish it then, I shall bring suit for
divorce and alimony against Horace Endicott, and have
the papers served on Arthur Dillon. He can ignore them
or make his reply. In either case he must be brought to
make affidavit that he is not the man you look for."</p>

<p>"And the others? The priest and Mrs. Dillon?"
asked Edith.</p>

<p>"They are of no consequence," was Sonia's opinion.</p>

<p>After settling unimportant details the two women departed.
Livingstone found the problem which they had
brought to his notice fascinating. He had always marked
Arthur Dillon among his associates, as an able and
peculiar young man, he had been attracted by him, and
had listened to his speeches with more consideration than
most young men deserved. His amazing success in deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>ing
with a Livingstone, his audacity and nerve in attacking
the policy which he brought to nothing, were more
wonderful to the lawyer than to the friends of Dillon, who
had not seen the task in its entirety.</p>

<p>And this peculiar fellow was thought to be an Endicott,
of his own family, of the English blood, more Irish than
the Irish, bitterer towards him than the priests had been.
The very impossibility of the thing made it charming.
What course of thought, what set of circumstances, could
turn the Puritan mind in the Celtic direction? Was
there such genius in man to convert one personality into
another so neatly that the process remained undiscoverable,
not to be detected by the closest observation? He
shook off the fascination. These two women believed it,
but he knew that no Endicott could ever be converted.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ARTHUR'S APPEAL.</h3>


<p>Suit was promptly begun by Livingstone on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Sonia for a divorce from Horace Endicott. Before the
papers had been fully made out, even before the officer
had been instructed to serve them on Arthur Dillon, the
lawyer received an evening visit from the defendant himself.
As a suspicious act he welcomed it; but a single
glance at the frank face and easy manner, when one knew
the young man's ability, disarmed suspicion. The lawyer
studied closely, for the first time with interest, the man
who might yet prove to be his kinsman. He saw a form
inclined to leanness, a face that might have been handsome
but for the sunken cheeks, dark and expressive eyes
whose natural beauty faded in the dark circles around
them, a fine head with dead black hair, and a handsome
beard, streaked with gray. His dress, gentleman-like but
of a strange fashion, the lawyer did not recognize as the
bachelor costume of Cherry Hill prepared by his own
tailor. Nothing of the Endicott in face or manner, nothing
tragical, the expression decorous and formal, perhaps
a trifle quizzical, as this was their first meeting since the
interview in London.</p>

<p>"I have called to enter a protest," Arthur began
primly, "against the serving of the papers in the coming
Endicott divorce case on your humble servant."</p>

<p>"As the papers are to be served only on Horace Endicott,
I fail to see how you have any right or reason to protest,"
was the suave answer.</p>

<p>"I know all about the matter, sir, for very good reasons.
For some months the movements of the two women
concerned in this affair have been watched in my interest.
Not long after they left you a few days ago, the result
of their visit was made known to me. To anticipate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
disagreeable consequences of serving the papers on me, I
have not waited. I appeal to you not only as the lawyer
of Mrs. Endicott, but also as one much to blame for the
new persecution which is about to fall upon me."</p>

<p>"I recognize the touch," said Livingstone, unable to
resist a smile. "Mr. Dillon must be audacious or
nothing."</p>

<p>"I am quite serious," Arthur replied. "You know
part of the story, what Mrs. Endicott chose to tell you,
but I can enlighten you still more. I appeal to you, as
the lady's lawyer, to hinder her from doing mischief; and
again I appeal to you as one to blame in part for the
threatened annoyances. But for the lady who accompanied
Mrs. Endicott, I would not be suspected of relationship
with your honored family. But for the discipline
which I helped to procure for that lady, she would have
left me in peace. But for your encouragement of the
lady, I would not have been forced to subject a woman to
discipline. You may remember the effective Sister
Claire?"</p>

<p>So true was the surprise that Livingstone blushed with
sudden violence.</p>

<p>"That woman was the so-called escaped nun?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Now Mrs. Curran, wife of the detective employed by
Mrs. Endicott for five years to discover her lost husband.
She satisfies her noblest aspirations by dancing in the
theaters, ... and a very fine dancer she is. Her leisure
is devoted to plotting vengeance on me. She pretends to
believe that I am Horace Endicott; perhaps she does believe
it. Anyway she knows that persecution will result,
and she has persuaded Mrs. Endicott to inaugurate it. I
do not know if you were her selection to manage the
case."</p>

<p>This time Livingstone did not blush, being prepared
for any turn of mood and speech from this singular young
man.</p>

<p>"As the matter was described to me," he said, "only a
sentimental reason included you in the divorce proceedings.
I can understand Mrs. Curran's feelings, and to
what they would urge a woman of that character. Still,
her statements here were very plausible."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. She made her career up to this mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>ment
on the plausible. Let me tell you, if it is not too
tedious, how she has pursued this theory in the face of all
good sense."</p>

<p>The lawyer bowed his permission.</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that the creature is half mad, or subject
to fits of insanity. Her husband had talked much of
the Endicott case, which was not good for a woman of her
peculiarities. By inspiration, insane suggestion, she assumed
that I was the man sought for, and built up the
theory as you have heard. First, she persuaded her good-natured
husband, with whom I am acquainted, to investigate
among my acquaintances for the merest suspicion,
doubt, of my real personality. A long and minute inquiry,
the details of which are in writing in my possession, was
made by the detective with one result: that no one
doubted me to be what I was born."</p>

<p>Livingstone cast a look at him to see the expression
which backed that natural and happy phrase. Arthur
Dillon might have borne it.</p>

<p>"She kept at her husband, however, until he had tried
to surprise my relatives, my friends, my nurse, and my
mother, ... yes, even my confessor, into admissions
favorable to her mad dream. My rooms, my papers, my
habits, my secrets were turned inside out; Mrs. Endicott
was brought on from Boston to study me in my daily life;
for days I was watched by the three. In the detective's
house I was drugged into a profound sleep, and for ten
minutes the two women examined my sleeping face for
signs of Horace Endicott. When all these things failed,
Sister Claire dragged her unwilling husband to California,
where I had spent ten years of my life, and tried hard to
find another Arthur Dillon, or to disconnect me with myself.
She proved to her own satisfaction that these things
could not be done. But there is a devil of perversity in
her. She is like a boa constrictor ... I think that's the
snake which cannot let go its prey once it has seized it.
She can't let go. In desperation she is risking her own
safety and happiness to make public her belief that I am
Horace Endicott. In spite of the overwhelming proofs
against the theory, and in favor of me, she is bent on
bringing the case into court."</p>

<p>"Risking her own safety and happiness?" Livingstone
repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the wild geese among the Irish could locate Sister
Claire, who is supposed to have fled the town long ago, her
life would be taken. If this suit continues she will have
to leave the city forever. Knowing this the devil in her
urges her to her own ruin."</p>

<p>"You have kept close track of her," said Livingstone.</p>

<p>"You left me no choice," was the reply, "having
sprung the creature on us, and then thrown her off when
you found out her character. If she had only turned on
her abettors and wracked them I wouldn't have cared."</p>

<p>"You protest then against the serving of these papers
on you. Would it not be better to settle forever the last
doubts in so peculiar a matter?"</p>

<p>"What have I to do with the doubts of an escaped nun,
and of Mrs. Endicott? Must I go to court and stand the
odium of a shameful imputation to settle the doubts of a
lunatic criminal and a woman whose husband fled from
her with his entire fortune?"</p>

<p>"It is regrettable," the lawyer admitted with surprise.
"As Mrs. Endicott is perhaps the most deeply interested,
I fear that the case must go on."</p>

<p>"I have come to show you that it will not be to the interest
of the two women that it should go on. In fact I
feel quite certain that you will not serve those papers on
me after I have laid a few facts before you."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to examine them in the interest of my
client."</p>

<p>"Having utterly failed to prove me other than I am,"
Arthur said easily, while the lawyer watched with increasing
interest the expressive face, "these women have
accepted your suggestion to put me under oath as to my
own personality. I would not take affidavit," and his contempt
was evident. "I am not going to permit any public
or official attempt to cast doubt on my good name. You
can understand the feeling. My mother and my friends
are not accustomed to the atmosphere of courts, nor of
scandal. It would mean severe suffering for them to be
dragged into so sensational a trial. The consequences
one cannot measure beforehand. The unpleasantness
lives after all the parties are dead. Since I can prevent
it I am going to do it. As far as I am concerned Mrs.
Endicott must be content with a simple denial, or a simple
affirmation rather, that I am Arthur Dillon, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>fore
not her husband. It is more than she deserves, because
there is not a shred of evidence to warrant her
making a single move against me. She has not been
able to find in me a feature resembling her husband."</p>

<p>"Then, you are prepared to convince Mrs. Endicott
that she has more to lose than to gain by bringing you
into her divorce suit?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Here is the point for her to consider: if
the papers in this suit are served upon me, then there
will be no letting-up afterward. Her affairs, the affairs
of this woman Curran, the lives of both to the last detail,
will be served up to the court and the public. You know
how that can be done. I would rather not have it done,
but I proffer Mrs. Endicott the alternative."</p>

<p>"I do not know how strong an argument that would
be with Mrs. Endicott," said Livingstone with interest.</p>

<p>"She is too shallow a woman to perceive its strength,
unless you, as her lawyer and kinsman, make it plain to
her," was the guileless answer. "Mrs. Curran knows
nothing of court procedure, but she is clever enough to
foresee consequences, and her history before her New
York fiasco includes bits of romance from the lives of important
people."</p>

<p>Livingstone resisted the inclination to laugh, and then
to get angry.</p>

<p>"You think then, that if Mrs. Endicott could be made
to see the possibilities of a desperate trial, the possible exposures
of her sins and the sins of others, that she would
not risk it?"</p>

<p>"She has family pride," said Arthur seriously, "and
would not care to expose her own to scorn. I presume you
know something about the Endicott disappearance?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than the fact, and the failure to find
the young man?"</p>

<p>"His wife employed the detective Curran to make the
search for Endicott, and Curran is a Fenian, as interested
as myself in such matters. He was with me in the little
enterprise which ended so fatally for Ledwith and ...
others." Livingstone was too sore on this subject to
smile at the pause and the word. "Curran told me the
details after he had left the pursuit of Endicott. They
are known now to Mrs. Endicott's family in part. It is
understood that she will marry her cousin Quincy Lenox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
when she gets a divorce. He was devoted to her before
her marriage and is faithful still, I am told."</p>

<p>Not a sign of feeling in the utterance of these significant
words!</p>

<p>"It is not affection, then, which prompts the actions
of my client? She wishes to make sure of the existence
or non-existence of her husband before entering upon this
other marriage?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can tell you only what the detective and
one other told us," Arthur said. "When Horace Endicott
disappeared, it is said, he took with him his entire
fortune, something over a million, leaving not one cent
to his wife. He had converted his property into cash secretly.
Her anxiety to find him is very properly to get
her lawful share in that property, that is, alimony with
her divorce?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Livingstone, and he began to understand
the lines and shadows on this young man's face. "A
peculiar, and I suppose thorough, revenge."</p>

<p>"If the papers are served on me, you understand, then
in one fashion or another Mrs. Endicott shall be brought
to court, and Quincy Lenox too, with the detective and
his wife, and a few others. It is almost too much that
you have been made acquainted with the doubts of these
people. I bear with it, but I shall not endure one degree
more of publicity. Once it is known that I am thought
to be Horace Endicott, then the whole world must know
quite as thoroughly that I am Arthur Dillon; and also
who these people are that so foolishly pursue me. It cannot
but appear to the average crowd that this new
form of persecution is no more than an outgrowth of
the old."</p>

<p>Then they glared at each other mildly, for the passions
of yesterday were still warm. Livingstone's mood had
changed, however. He felt speculatively certain that
Horace Endicott sat before him, and he knew Sonia to be
a guilty woman. As his mind flew over the humiliating
events which connected him with Dillon, consolation
soothed his wounded heart that he had been overthrown
perhaps by one of his own, rather than by the Irish. The
unknown element in the contest had given victory to the
lucky side. He recalled his sense of this young fellow's
superiority to his environment. He tried to fathom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Arthur's motive in this visit, but failed. As a matter of
fact Arthur was merely testing the thoroughness of his
own disappearance. His visit to Livingstone the real Dillon
would have made. It would lead the lawyer to believe
that Sonia, in giving up her design, had been moved by
his advice and not by a quiet, secret conversation with her
husband. Livingstone quickly made up his mind that
the divorce suit would have to be won by default, but he
wished to learn more of this daring and interesting kinsman.</p>

<p>"The decision must remain with Mrs. Endicott," he
said after a pause. "I shall tell her, before your name
is mixed up with the matter, just what she must expect.
If she has anything to fear from a public trial you are
undoubtedly the man to bring it out."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"I might even use persuasion ..."</p>

<p>"It would be a service to the Endicott family," Arthur
said earnestly, "for I can swear to you that the truth
will come out, the scandal which Horace Endicott fled to
avoid and conceal forever."</p>

<p>"Did you know Endicott?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed. I was his guide in California every
time he made a trip to that country."</p>

<p>"I might persuade Mrs. Endicott," said the lawyer
with deeper interest, "for the sake of the family name, to
surrender her foolish theory. It is quite clear to any one
with unbiased judgment that you are not Horace Endicott,
even if you are not Arthur Dillon. I knew the young
man slightly, and his family very well. I can see myself
playing the part which you have presented to us for the
past five years, quite as naturally as Horace Endicott
would have played it. It was not in Horace's nature, nor
in the Endicott nature to turn Irish so completely."</p>

<p>Arthur felt all the bitterness and the interest which this
shot implied.</p>

<p>"I had the pleasure of knowing Endicott well, much
better than you, sir," he returned warmly, "and while I
know he was something of a good-natured butterfly, I can
say something for his fairness and courage. If he had
known what I know of the Irish, of their treatment by
their enemies at home and here, of English hypocrisy and
American meanness, of their banishment from the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
God gave them and your attempt to drive them out of
New York or to keep them in the gutter, he would have
taken up their cause as honestly as I have done."</p>

<p>"You are always the orator, Mr. Endi ... Dillon."</p>

<p>"I have feeling, which is rare in the world," said Arthur
smiling. "Do you know what this passion for justice
has done for me, Mr. Livingstone? It has brought out
in me the eloquence which you have praised, and inspired
the energy, the deviltry, the trickery, the courage, that
were used so finely at your expense.</p>

<p>"I was like Endicott, a wild irresponsible creature,
thinking only of my own pleasure. Out of my love for
one country which is not mine, out of a study of the
wrongs heaped upon the Irish by a civilized people, I have
secured the key to the conditions of the time. I have
learned to despise and pity the littleness of your party, to
recognize the shams of the time everywhere, the utter
hypocrisy of those in power.</p>

<p>"I have pledged myself to make war on them as I made
war on you; on the power that, mouthing liberty, holds
Ireland in slavery; on the powers that, mouthing order
and peace, hold down Poland, maintain Turkey, rob and
starve India, loot the helpless wherever they may. I was
a harmless hypocrite and mostly a fool once. Time and
hardship and other things, chiefly Irish and English, have
given me a fresh start in the life of thought. You hardly
understand this, being thoroughly English in your
make-up.</p>

<p>"You love good Protestants, pagans who hate the Pope,
all who bow to England, and that part of America which
is English. You can blow about their rights and liberties,
and denounce their persecutors, if these happen to
be French or Dutch or Russian. For a Pole or an Irishman
you have no sympathy, and you would deny him any
place on the earth but a grave. Liberty is not for him
unless he becomes a good English Protestant at the same
time. In other words liberty may be the proper sauce for
the English goose but not for the Irish gander."</p>

<p>"I suppose it appears that way to you," said Livingstone,
who had listened closely, not merely to the sentiments,
but to the words, the tone, the idiom. Could
Horace Endicott have ever descended to this view of his
world, this rawness of thought, sentiment, and expression?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
So peculiarly Irish, anti-English, rich with the flavor of
the Fourth Ward, and nevertheless most interesting.</p>

<p>"I shall not argue the point," he continued. "I judge
from your earnestness that you have a well-marked ambition
in life, and that you will follow it."</p>

<p>"My present ambition is to see our grand cathedral
completed and dedicated as soon as possible, as the loudest
word we can speak to you about our future. But I fear
I am detaining you. If during the next few days the
papers in the divorce case are not served on me, I may
feel certain that Mrs. Endicott has given up the idea of
including me in the suit?"</p>

<p>"I shall advise her to leave you in peace for the sake of
the Endicott name," said Livingstone politely.</p>

<p>Arthur thanked him and departed, while the lawyer
spent an hour enjoying his impressions and vainly trying
to disentangle the Endicott from the Dillon in this extraordinary
man.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE END OF MISCHIEF.</h3>


<p>Arthur set out for the Curran household, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
was awaited with anxiety. Quite cheerful over his command
of the situation, and inclined to laugh at the mixed
feelings of Livingstone, he felt only reverence and awe
before the human mind as seen in the light of his own
experience. His particular mind had once been Horace
Endicott's, but now represented the more intense and
emotional personality of Arthur Dillon. He was neither
Horace, nor the boy who had disappeared; but a new being
fashioned after the ideal Arthur Dillon, as Horace Endicott
had conceived him. What he had been seemed no
more a part of his past, but a memory attached to another
man. All his actions proved it.</p>

<p>The test of his disappearance delighted him. He had
gone through its various scenes with little emotion, with
less than Edith had displayed; far less than Arthur Dillon
would have felt and shown. Who can measure the mind?
Itself the measure of man's knowledge, the judge in the
court of human destiny, how feeble its power over itself!
A few years back this mind directed Horace Endicott; to-day
it cheerfully served the conscience of Arthur Dillon!</p>

<p>Edith and her husband awaited their executioner. The
detective suffered for her rather than himself. From
Dillon he had nothing to fear, and for his sake, also for
the strange regard he had always kept for Curran's wife,
Arthur had been kind when harshness would have done
more good. Now the end had come for her and Sonia.
As the unexpected usually came from this young man,
they had reason to feel apprehension. He took his seat
comfortably in the familiar chair, and lit his cigar while
chaffing her.</p>

<p>"They who love the danger shall perish in it," he said
for a beginning. "You court it, Colette, and not very
wisely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"How, not wisely?" she asked with a pretence of
boldness.</p>

<p>"You count on the good will of the people whom you
annoy and wrong, and yet you have never any good will to
give them in return. You have hated me and pursued me
on the strength of my good will for you. It seems never
to have occurred to you to do me a good turn for the many
I have done for you. You are a bud of incarnate evil,
Colette."</p>

<p>How she hated him when he talked in that fashion!</p>

<p>"Well, it's all settled. I have had the last talk with
Livingstone, and spoiled your last trick against the comfort
of Arthur Dillon. There will be no dragging to court
of the Dillon clan. Mr. Livingstone believes with me that
the publicity would be too severe for Mrs. Endicott and
her family, not to mention the minor revelations connected
with yourself. So there's the end of your precious tomfoolery,
Colette."</p>

<p>She burst into vehement tears.</p>

<p>"But you weep too soon," he protested. "I have saved
you as usual from yourself, but only to inflict my own
punishment. Don't weep those crocodile diamonds until
you have heard your own sentence. Of course you know
that I have followed every step you took in this matter.
You are clever enough to have guessed that. You discovered
all that was to be discovered, of course. But you
are too keen. If this trial had come to pass you would
have been on the witness stand, and the dogs would have
caught the scent then never to lose it. You would have
ruined your husband as well as yourself."</p>

<p>"Why do you let him talk to me so?" she screamed at
Curran.</p>

<p>"Because it is for your good," Arthur answered. "But
here's briefness. You must leave New York at once, and
forever. Get as far from it as you can, and stay there
while I am alive. And for consolation in your exile take
your child with you, your little boy, whom Mrs. Endicott
parades as her little son, the heir of her beloved Horace."</p>

<p>A frightful stillness fell in the room with this terrific
declaration. But for pity he could have laughed at the
paralysis which seized both the detective and his wife.
Edith sat like a statue, white-faced, pouting at him, her
hands clasped in her lap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, are you surprised? You, the clever one? If I
am Horace Endicott, as you pretend to believe, do I not
know the difference between my own child and another's?
I am Arthur Dillon only, and yet I know how you conspired
with Mrs. Endicott to provide her with an heir for
the Endicott money. You did this in spite of your husband,
who has never been able to control you, not even
when you chose to commit so grave a crime. Now, it is
absolutely necessary for the child's sake that you save him
from Mrs. Endicott's neglect, when he is of no further
use to her. She loves children, as you know."</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" Curran burst out hoarsely
after a while.</p>

<p>"Not half as good a detective as you are, but I happen
in this matter to be on the inside," Arthur answered
cheerfully. "I knew Horace Endicott much better than
his wife or his friends. The poor fellow is dead and gone,
and yet he left enough information behind him to trouble
the clever people. Are you satisfied, Colette, that this
time everything must be done as I have ordered?"</p>

<p>"You have proved yourself Horace Endicott," she
gasped in her rage, burning with hate, mortification,
shame, fifty tigerish feelings that could not find expression.</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, Colette! You have proved that I am Arthur
Dillon. Why go back on your own work? If you had
known Horace Endicott as I did, you would not compare
the meek and civilized Dillon with the howling demon into
which his wife turned him. That fellow would not have sat
in your presence ten minutes knowing that you had palmed
off your child as his, without taking your throat in his
hands for a death squeeze. His wife would not have escaped
death from the madman had he ever encountered
her. Here are your orders now; it is late and I must not
keep you from your beauty sleep; take the child as soon
as the Endicott woman sends him to you, and leave New
York one hundred miles behind you. If you are found in
this city any time after the month of September, you take
all the risks. I shall not stand between you and justice
again. You are the most ungrateful sinner that I have
ever dealt with. Now go and weep for yourself. Don't
waste any tears on Mrs. Endicott."</p>

<p>Sobbing like an angry and humiliated child, Edith
rushed out of the room. Curran felt excessively foolish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Though partly in league with Arthur, the present situation
went beyond him.</p>

<p>"Be hanged if I don't feel like demanding an explanation,"
he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>"You don't need it," said Arthur as he proceeded to
make it. "Can't you see that Horace Endicott is acting
through me, and has been from the first, to secure the things
I have secured. He is dead as I told you. How he got
away, kept himself hid, and all that, you are as good an
authority as I. While he was alive you could have found
him as easily as I could, but he was beyond search always,
though I guess not beyond betrayal. Well, let me congratulate
you on getting your little family together again.
Don't worry over what has happened to-night. Drop the
Endicott case. You can see there's no luck in it for any
one."</p>

<p>Certainly there had been no luck in it for the Currans.
Arthur went to his club in the best humor, shaking with
laughter over the complete crushing of Edith, with whom
he felt himself quite even in the contest that had endured
so long. Next morning it would be Sonia's turn. Ah,
what a despicable thing is man's love, how unstable and
profitless! No wonder Honora valued it so lightly. How
Horace Endicott had raved over this whited sepulcher five
years ago, believed in her, sworn by her virtue and truth!
And to-day he regarded her without feeling, neither love
nor hate, perfect indifference only marking his mental
attitude in her regard. Somehow one liked to feel that
love is unchangeable, as with the mother, the father; as
with God also, for whom sin does not change relationship
with the sinner.</p>

<p>When he stood before her the next day in the hotel
parlor, she reminded him in her exquisite beauty of a play
seen from the back of the stage; the illusion so successful
with the audience is there an exposed sham, without coherence,
and without beauty. Her eyes had a scared look.
She had to say to herself, if this is Horace then my time
has come, if it is Arthur Dillon I have nothing to worry
about, before her hate came to her aid and gave her courage.
She murmured the usual formula of unexpected pleasure.
He bowed, finding no pleasure in this part of his revenge.
Arthur Dillon could not have been more considerate of
Messalina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is certainly a privilege and an honor," said he, "to
be suspected of so charming a relationship with Mrs. Endicott.
Nevertheless I have persuaded your lawyer, Mr.
Livingstone, that it would be unprofitable and imprudent
to bring me into the suit for divorce. He will so advise
you I think to-day."</p>

<p>She smiled at the compliment and felt reassured.</p>

<p>"There were some things which I could not tell the
lawyer," he went on, "and so I made bold to call on you
personally. It is disagreeable, what I must tell you. My
only apology is that you yourself have made this visit necessary
by bringing my name into the case."</p>

<p>Her smile died away, and her face hardened. She prepared
herself for trouble.</p>

<p>"I told your lawyer that if the papers were served on
me, and a public and official doubt thrown on my right to
the name of Arthur Dillon, I would not let the business
drop until the Endicott-Curran-Dillon mystery had been
thoroughly ventilated in the courts. He agreed with me
that this would expose the Endicott name to scandal."</p>

<p>"We have been perhaps too careful from the beginning
about the Endicott name," she said severely. "Which is
the reason why no advance has been made in the search for
my dear husband."</p>

<p>"That may be true, Mrs. Endicott. You must not forget,
however, that you will be a witness, and Mrs. Curran,
and her husband, and Mr. Quincy Lenox, and others besides.
How do you think these people would stand questioning
as to who your little boy, called Horace Endicott,
really is?"</p>

<p>She sat prepared for a dangerous surprise, but not for
this horror; and the life left her on the spot, for the poor
weed was as soft and cowardly as any other product of the
swamp. He rang for restoratives and sent for her maid.
In ten minutes, somewhat restored, she faced the ordeal, if
only to learn what this terrible man knew.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked feebly, the same question
asked by Curran in his surprise.</p>

<p>"A friend of Horace Endicott," he answered quietly.</p>

<p>"And what do you know of us?"</p>

<p>"All that Horace knew."</p>

<p>She could not summon courage to put a third question.
He came to her aid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you are not sure about what Horace knew?
Shall I tell you? I did not tell your lawyer. I only hinted
that the truth would be brought out if my name was dragged
into the case against my protest. Shall I tell you what
Horace knew?"</p>

<p>With closed eyes she made a sign of acquiescence.</p>

<p>"He knew of your relations with Quincy Lenox. He
saw you together on a certain night, when he arrived home
after a few days' absence. He also heard your conversation.
In this you admitted that out of hatred for your husband
you had destroyed his heir before the child was born. He
knew your plan of retrieving that blunder by adopting the
child of Edith Curran, and palming him off as your own.
He knew of your plan to secure the good will of his Aunt
Lois for the impostor, and found the means to inform his
aunt of the fraud. All that he knew will be brought out
at any trial in which my name shall be included. Your
lawyer will tell you that it cannot be avoided. Therefore,
when your lawyer advises you to get a divorce from your
former husband without including me as that husband,
yon had better accept that advice."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and stared at him with insane fright.
Who but Horace Endicott could know her crimes? All
but the crime which he had named her blunder. Could this
passionless stranger, this Irish politician, looking at her as
indifferently as the judge on the bench, be Horace? No,
surely no! Because that fool, dolt though he was, would
never have seen this wretched confession of her crimes,
and not slain her the next minute. Into this ambuscade
had she been led by the crazy wife of Curran, whose sound
advice she herself had thrown aside to follow the instincts
of Edith. Recovering her nerve quickly, she began her
retreat as well as one might after so disastrous a field.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to have disturbed you, Mr. Dillon,"
she said. "You may rest assured that no further attempt
will be made on your good name. Since you pretend to
such intimacy with my unfortunate husband I would like
to ask you...."</p>

<p>"That was the extent of my intimacy, Mrs. Endicott,
and I would never have revealed it except to defend myself,"
he interrupted suavely. "Of course the revelation
brings consequences. You must arrange to have your little
Horace die properly in some remote country, surround his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
funeral with all the legal formalities, and so on. That
will be easy. Meanwhile you can return the boy to his
mother, who is ready to receive him. Then your suit for
divorce must continue, and you will win it by default, that
is, by the failure of Horace Endicott to defend his side.
When these things are done, it would be well for your
future happiness to lay aside further meddling with the
mystery of your husband's disappearance."</p>

<p>"I have learned a lesson," she said more composedly.
"I shall do as you command, because I feel sure it is a
command. I have some curiosity however about the life
which Horace led after he disappeared. Since you must
have known him a little, would it be asking too much from
you...."</p>

<p>She lost her courage at sight of his expression. Her
voice faded. Oh, shallow as any frog-pond, indecently
shallow, to ask such a question of the judge who had just
ordered her to execution. His contempt silenced her.
With a formal apology for having caused her so much
pain, he bowed and withdrew. Some emotion had stirred
him during the interview, but he had kept himself well
under control. Later he found it was horror, ever to have
been linked with a monster; and dread too that in a
sudden access of passion he might have done her to death.
It seemed natural and righteous to strike and destroy the
reptile.</p>

<p>Of these strange and stirring events no one knew but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Arthur himself; nor of the swift consequences, the
divorce of Sonia from her lost husband, her marriage to
Quincy Lenox, the death and burial of her little boy in
England, and the establishment of La Belle Colette and
her son Horace in Chicago, where the temptation to annoy
her enemies disappeared, and the risk to herself was practically
removed forever. Thus faded the old life out of
Arthur's view, its sin-stained personages frightened off the
scene by his well-used knowledge of their crimes. Whatever
doubt they held about his real character, self-interest
accepted him as Arthur Dillon.</p>

<p>He was free. Honora saw the delight of that freedom
in his loving and candid expression. He repressed his
feelings no more, no longer bound.</p>

<p>He was gayer than ever before, with the gaiety of his
nature, not of the part which he had played. Honora
knew how deeply she loved him, from her very dread of
inflicting on him that pain which was bound to come.
The convent would be her rich possession; but he who
had given her and her father all that man could give, he
would have only bitter remembrance. How bitter that
could be experience with her father informed her. The
mystery of his life attracted her. If not Arthur Dillon,
who was he? What tragedy had driven him from one
life into another? Did it explain that suffering so clearly
marked on his face? To which she must add, as part of
the return to be made for all his goodness!</p>

<p>Her pity for him grew, and prompted deeper tenderness;
and how could she know, who had been without experience,
that pity is often akin to love?</p>

<p>The heavenly days flew by like swift swallows. September
came with its splendid warnings of change. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
trees were suddenly bordered in gold yellow and dotted
with fire-red. The nights began to be haunted by cool
winds. Louis packed his trunk early in the month. His
long vacations had ended, ordination was at hand, and his
life-work would begin in the month of October.</p>

<p>The household went down to the city for the grand
ceremony. Mona and her baby remained in the city then,
while the others returned to the lake for a final week,
Anne with perfect content, Honora in calmness of spirit,
but also in dread for Arthur's sake. He seemed to have
no misgivings. Her determination continued, and the situation
therefore remained as clear as the cold September
mornings. Yet some tie bound them, elusive, beyond
description, but so much in evidence that every incident
of the waiting time seemed to strengthen it. Delay did
not abate her resolution, but it favored his hope.</p>

<p>"Were you disturbed by the revelations of Mrs. Curran?"
he said as they sat, for the last time indeed, on the
terrace so fatal to Lord Constantine. Anne read the
morning newspaper in the shadow of the grove behind
them, with Judy to comment on the news. The day,
perfect, comfortable, without the perfume of August,
sparkled with the snap of September.</p>

<p>"My curiosity was disturbed," she admitted frankly,
and her heart beat, for the terrible hour had come. "I
felt that your life had some sadness and mystery in it, but
it was a surprise to hear that you were not Anne Dillon's
long-lost son."</p>

<p>"That was pure guess-work on Colette's part, you know.
She's a born devil, if there are such things among us
humans. I'll tell you about her some time. Then the
fact of my wife's existence did not disturb you at all?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it soothed me, I think," she said with
a blush.</p>

<p>"I know why. Well, it will take my story to explain
hers. She told the truth in part, poor Colette. Once
I had a wife, before I became Anne Dillon's son. Will it
be too painful for you to hear the story? It is mournful.
To no one have I ever told it complete; in fact I
could not, only to you. How I have burned to tell it
from beginning to end to the true heart. I could not
shock Louis, the dear innocent, and it was necessary to
keep most of it from my mother, for legal reasons. Mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>signor
has heard the greater part, but not all. And I
have been like the Ancient Mariner.</p>

How can I help but listen?"</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Do you remember how we read and re-read it on the <i>Arrow</i>
years ago? Somehow it has rung in my ears ever since,
Honora. My life had a horror like it. Had it not passed
I could not speak of it even to you. Long ago I was an
innocent fool whom men knew in the neighborhood of
Cambridge as Horace Endicott. I was an orphan, without
guides, or real friends. I felt no need of them, for
was I not rich, and happily married? Good nature and
luck had carried me along lazily like that pine-stick
floating down there. What a banging it would get on
this rocky shore if a good south wind sprang up. For
a long time I escaped the winds. When they came....
I'll tell you who I was and what she was. Do you remember
on the <i>Arrow</i> Captain Curran's story of Tom
Jones?"</p>

<p>He looked up at her interested face, and saw the violet
eyes widen with sudden horror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember," she cried with astonishment and pain.
"You, Arthur, you the victim of that shameful story?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember what you said then, Honora, when
Curran declared he would one day find Tom Jones?"</p>

<p>She knew by the softness of his speech that her saying
had penetrated the lad's heart, and had been treasured till
this day, would be treasured forever.</p>

<p>"And you were sitting there, in the cabin, not ten feet
off, listening to him and me?" she said with a gasp of
pleasure.</p>

<p>"'You will never find him, Captain Curran ... that
fearful woman shattered his very soul ... I know the
sort of man he was ... he will never go back ... if he
can bear to live, it will be because in his obscurity God
gave him new faith and hope in human nature, and in the
woman's part of it.' Those are your words, Honora."</p>

<p>She blushed with pleasure and murmured: "I hope
they came true!"</p>

<p>"They were true at that moment," he said reflectively.
"Oh, indeed God guided me, placed me in the hands of
Monsignor, of my mother, of such people as Judy and the
Senator and Louis, and of you all."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, what suffering!" she exclaimed suddenly
as her tears began to fall. "Louis told me, I saw it
in your face as every one did, but now I know. And we
never gave you the pity you needed!"</p>

<p>"Then you must give it to me now," said he with boldness.
"But don't waste any pity on Endicott. He is
dead, and I look at him across these five years as at a
stranger. Suffer? The poor devil went mad with suffering.
He raved for days in the wilderness, after he discovered
his shame, dreaming dreams of murder for the
guilty, of suicide for himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in anguish and turned toward
him as if to protect him.</p>

<p>"It was a good woman who saved him, and she was an
old mother who had tasted death. Some day I shall show
you the pool where this old woman found him, after he
had overcome the temptation to die. She took him to her
home and her heart, nourished him, gave him courage,
sent him on a new mission of life. What a life! He had
a scheme of vengeance, and to execute it he had to return
to the old scenes, where he was more alone&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Alone, alone, all, all alone,<br />
Alone on a wide, wide sea!<br />
And never a saint took pity on<br />
My soul in agony.<br />
<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 1em; padding-left: 1em;">* * * * *</span>
<br />
<br />
O wedding-guest! this soul hath been<br />
Alone on a wide, wide sea;<br />
So lonely 'twas that God Himself<br />
Scarce seemed there to be."<br />
</div></div>

<p>The wonder to Honora, as he described himself, was
the indifference of his tone. It had no more than the
sympathy one might show toward a stranger whose suffering
had been succeeded by great joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, God grant," he broke in with vehemence, "that
no soul suffers as did this Endicott, poor wretch, during
the time of his vengeance. Honora, I would not inflict
on that terrible woman the suffering of that man for a
year after his discovery of her sin. I doubted long the
mercy of God. Rather I knew nothing about His mercy.
I had no religion, no understanding of it, except in a
vague, unpractical way. You know now that I am of the
Puritan race ... Livingstone is of my family ... the
race which dislikes the Irish and the Catholic as the English
dislike them ... the race that persecuted yours!
But you cannot say that I have not atoned for them as
nearly as one man can?"</p>

<p>Trembling with emotion, she simply raised her hands in
a gesture that said a thousand things too beautiful for
words.</p>

<p>"My vengeance on the guilty was to disappear. I took
with me all my property, and I left Messalina with her
own small dower to enjoy her freedom in poverty. She
sought for me, hired that detective and others to hound
me to my hiding-place, and so far has failed to make sure
of me. But to have you understand the story clearly, I
shall stick to the order of events. I had known Monsignor
a few days before calamity overtook me, and to him I
turned for aid. It was he who found a mother for me, a
place among 'the mere Irish,' a career which has turned
out very well. You know how Anne Dillon lost her son.
What no one knows is this: three months before she was
asked to take part in the scheme of disappearance she sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
a thousand photographs of her dead husband and her lost
son to the police of California, and offered a reward for his
discovery living or dead. Monsignor helped her to that.
I acknowledged that advertisement from one of the most
obscure and ephemeral of the mining-camps, and came
home as her son."</p>

<p>"And the real Arthur Dillon? He was never found?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he answered it too, indirectly. While I was
loitering riotously about, awaiting the proper moment to
make myself known, I heard that one Arthur Dillon was
dying in another mining-camp some thirty miles to the
north of us. He claimed to be the real thing, but he was
dying of consumption, and was too feeble, and of too little
consequence, to be taken notice of. I looked after him
till he died, and made sure of his identity. He was Anne
Dillon's son and he lies in the family lot in Calvary beside
his father. No one knows this but his mother, Monsignor,
and ourselves. Colette stumbled on the fact in her
search of California, but the fates have been against that
clever woman."</p>

<p>He laughed heartily at the complete overthrow of the
escaped nun. Honora looked at him in astonishment.
Arthur Dillon laughed, quite forgetful of the tragedy of
Horace Endicott.</p>

<p>"Since my return you know what I have been, Honora.
I can appeal to you as did Augustus to his friends on his
dying-bed: have I not played well the part?"</p>

<p>"I am lost in wonder," she said.</p>

<p>"Then give me your applause as I depart," he answered
sadly, and her eyes fell before his eloquent glance. "In
those early days rage and hate, and the maddest desire for
justice, sustained me. That woman had only one wish in
life: to find, rob, and murder the man who had befooled
her worse than she had tricked him. I made war on that
man. I hated Horace Endicott as a weak fool. He had
fallen lowest of all his honest, able, stern race. I beat him
first into hiding, then into slavery, and at last into annihilation.
I studied to annihilate him, and I did it by raising
Arthur Dillon in his place. I am now Arthur Dillon.
I think, feel, act, speak, dream like that Arthur Dillon
which I first imagined. When you knew me first, Honora,
I was playing a part. I am no longer acting. I am the
man whom the world knows as Arthur Dillon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can see that, and it seems more wonderful than any
dream of romance. You a Puritan are more Irish than
the Irish, more Catholic than the Catholics, more Dillon
than the Dillons. Oh, how can this be?"</p>

<p>"Don't let it worry you," he said grimly. "Just
accept the fact and me. I never lived until Horace
Endicott disappeared. He was a child of fortune and a
lover of ease and pleasure. His greatest pain had been a
toothache. His view of life had been a boy's. When I
stepped on this great stage I found myself for the first
time in the very current of life. Suffering ate my heart
out, and I plunged into that current to deaden the agony.
I found myself by accident a leader of a poor people who
had fled from injustice at home to suffer a mean persecution
here. I was thrown in with the great men of the
hour, and found a splendid opponent in a member of the
Endicott family, Livingstone. I saw the very heart of
great things, and the look enchanted me.</p>

<p>"You know how I worked for my friends, for your
father, for the people, for every one and everything that
needed help. For the first time I saw into the heart of a
true friend. Monsignor helped me, carried me through,
stood by me, directed me. For the first time I saw into
the heart of innocence and sanctity, deep down, the heart
of that blessed boy, Louis. For the first time I looked
into the heart of a patriot, and learned of the love which
can endure, not merely failure, but absolute and final
disappointment, and still be faithful. I became an orator,
an adventurer, an enthusiast. The Endicott who could
not speak ten words before a crowd, the empty-headed
stroller who classed patriots with pickles, became what
you know me to be. I learned what love is, the love of
one's own; of mother, and friend, and clan. Let me not
boast, but I learned to know God and perhaps to love Him,
at least since I am resigned to His will. But I am talking
too much, since it is for the last time."</p>

<p>"You have not ended," said she beseechingly.</p>

<p>"It would take a lifetime," and he looked to see if she
would give him that time, but her eyes watched the lake.
"The latest events in my history took place this summer,
and you had a little share in them. By guess-work
Colette arrived at the belief that I am Horace Endicott, and
she set her detective-husband to discover the link between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Endicott and Dillon. I helped him, because I was curious
to see how Arthur Dillon would stand the test of direct
pursuit. They could discover nothing. As fast as a
trace of me showed it vanished into thin air. There was
nothing to do but invent a suit which would bring my
mother, Monsignor, and myself into court, and have us
declare under oath who is Arthur Dillon. I blocked that
game perfectly. Messalina has her divorce from Horace
Endicott, and is married to her lover. There will be no
further search for the man who disappeared. And I am
free, Monsignor declares. No ties bind me to that shameful
past. I have had my vengeance without publicity or
shame to anyone. I have punished as I had the right to
punish. I have a noble place in life, which no one can
take from me."</p>

<p>"And did you meet her since you left her ... that
woman?" Honora said in a low voice half ashamed of the
question.</p>

<p>"At Castle Moyna ..." he began and stopped dead at
a sudden recollection.</p>

<p>"I met her," cried Honora with a stifled scream, "I
met her."</p>

<p>"I met her again on the steamer returning," he said
after a pause. "She did not recognize me, nor has she
ever. We met for the last time in July. At that meeting
Arthur Dillon pronounced sentence on her in the name of
Horace Endicott. She will never wish to see me or her
lost husband again."</p>

<p>"Oh, how you must have suffered, Arthur, how you
must have suffered!"</p>

<p>She had grown pale alarmingly, but he did not perceive
it. The critical moment had come for him, and he was
praying silently against the expected blow. Her resolution
had left her, and the road had vanished in the obscurity of
night. She no longer saw her way clear. Her nerves had
been shaken by this wonderful story, and the surges of
feeling that rose before it like waves before the wind.</p>

<p>"And I must suffer still," he went on half to himself.
"I was sure that God would give me that which I most
desired, because I had given Him all that belonged to me.
I kept back nothing except as Monsignor ordered.
Through you, Honora, my faith in woman came back, as
you said it would when you answered the detective in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
behalf. When Monsignor told me I was free, that I could
speak to you as an honorable man, I took it as a sign from
heaven that the greatest of God's gifts was for me. I love
you so, Honora, that your wish is my only happiness.
Since you must go, if it is the will of God, do not mind my
suffering, which is also His will...."</p>

<p>He arose from his place and his knees were shaking.</p>

<p>"There is consolation for us all somewhere. Mine is
not to be here. The road to heaven is sometimes long.
Not here, Honora?"</p>

<p>The hope in him was not yet dead. She rose too and
put her arms about him, drawing his head to her bosom
with sudden and overpowering affection.</p>

<p>"Here and hereafter," she whispered, as they sat down
on the bench again.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"Judy," said Anne in the shade of the trees, "is Arthur
hugging Honora, or...."</p>

<p>"Glory be," whispered Judy with tears streaming down
her face, "it's Honora that's hugging Arthur ... no,
it's both o' them at wanst, thanks be to God."</p>

<p>And the two old ladies stole away home through the
happy woods.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THREE SCENES.</h3>


<p>Anne might have been the bitterest critic of Honora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
for her descent from the higher to the lesser life, but she
loved the girl too well even to look displeasure. Having
come to believe that Arthur would be hers alone forever,
she regarded Honora's decision as a mistake. The whole
world rejoiced at the union of these ideal creatures, even
Sister Magdalen, from whom Arthur had snatched a prize.
Honora was her own severest critic. How she had let
herself go in pity for a sufferer to whom her people, her
faith, her father, her friends, and herself owed much,
she knew not. His explanation was simple: God gave you
to me.</p>

<p>The process of surrender really began at Louis' ordination.
Arthur watched his boy, the center of the august
ceremony, with wet eyes. This innocent heart, with its
solemn aspirations, its spiritual beauty, had always been
for him a wonder and a delight; and it seemed fitting that
a life so mysteriously beautiful should end its novitiate
and begin its career with a ceremony so touching. The
September sun streamed through the venerable windows
of the cathedral, the music soared among the arches, the
altar glowed with lights and flowers; the venerable archbishop
and his priests and attendants filled the sanctuary,
an adoring crowd breathed with reverence in the nave;
but the center of the scene, its heart of beauty, was the
pale, sanctified son of Mary Everard.</p>

<p>For him were all these glories! Happy, happy, youth!
Blessed mother! There were no two like them in the
whole world, he said in his emotion. Her glorified face
often shone on him in the pauses of the ceremony. Her
look repeated the words she had uttered the night before:
"Under God my happiness is owing to you, Arthur Dillon:
like the happiness of so many others; and that I am not
to-day dead of sorrow and grief is also owing to you; now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
may God grant you the dearest wish of your heart, as
He has granted mine this day through you; for there is
nothing too good for a man with a heart and a hand like
yours."</p>

<p>How his heart had like to burst under that blessing!
He thought of Honora, not yet his own.</p>

<p>The entire Irishry was present, with their friends of
every race. In deference to his faithful adherent, the
great Livingstone sat in the very front pew, seriously attentive
to the rite, and studious of its significance.
Around him were grouped the well-beloved of Arthur Dillon,
the souls knit to his with the strength of heaven; the
Senator, high-colored, richly-dressed, resplendent, sincere;
the Boss, dark and taciturn, keen, full of emotion,
sighing from the depths of his rich nature over the meaning
of life, as it leaped into the light of this scene;
Birmingham, impressive and dignified, rejoicing at the
splendor so powerful with the world that reckons everything
by the outward show; and all the friends of the
new life, to whom this ceremony was dear as the breath
of their bodies. For this people the sanctuary signified
the highest honor, the noblest service, the loftiest glory.
Beside it the honors of the secular life, no matter how esteemed,
looked like dead flowers.</p>

<p>At times his emotion seemed to slip from the rein,
threatening to unman him. This child, whose innocent
hands were anointed with the Holy Oil, who was bound
and led away, who read the mass with the bishop and received
the Sacred Elements with him, upon whom the
prelate breathed solemn powers, who lay prostrate on the
floor, whose head was blessed by the hands of the assembled
priests: this child God had given him to replace the innocent
so cruelly destroyed long ago!</p>

<p>Honora's eyes hardly left Arthur's transfigured face,
which held her, charmed her, frightened her by its ever-changing
expression. Light and shadow flew across it as
over the depths of the sea. The mask off, the habit of
repression laid aside, his severe features responded to the
inner emotions. She saw his great eyes fill with tears,
his breast heave at times. As yet she had not heard his
story. The power of that story came less from the tale
than the recollection of scenes like this, which she unthinking
had witnessed in the years of their companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>ship.
What made this strange man so unlike all other
men?</p>

<p>At the close of the ordination the blessing from the
new priest began. Flushed, dewy-eyed, calm, and white,
Louis stood at the railing to lay his anointed hands on
each in turn; first the mother, and the father. Then
came a little pause, while Mona made way for him dearest
to all hearts that day, Arthur. He held back until he
saw that his delay retarded the ceremony, when he accepted
the honor. He felt the blessed hands on his head,
and a thrill leaped through him as the palms, odorous of
the balmy chrism, touched his lips.</p>

<p>Mona held up her baby with the secret prayer that he
too would be found worthy of the sanctuary; then
followed her husband and her sisters. Honora did not see as
she knelt how Arthur's heart leaped into his eyes, and
shot a burning glance at Louis to remind him of a request
uttered long ago: when you bless Honora, bless her for
me! Thus all conspired against her. Was it wonderful
that she left the cathedral drawn to her hero as never
before?</p>

<p>The next day Arthur told her with pride and tenderness,
as they drove to the church where Father Louis
was to sing his first Mass, that every vestment of the
young priest came from him. Sister Magdalen had made
the entire set, with her own hands embroidered them, and
he had borne the expense. Honora found her heart
melting under these beautiful details of an affection,
without limit. The depth of this man's heart seemed incredible,
deeper than her father's, as if more savage sorrow
had dug depths in what was deep enough by nature.
Long afterward she recognized how deeply the ordination
had affected her. It roused the feeling that such a heart
should not be lightly rejected.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Desolation seized her, as the vision of the convent
vanished like some lovely vale which one leaves forever.
Very simply he banished the desolation.</p>

<p>"I have been computing," he said, as they sat on the
veranda after breakfast, "what you might have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>worth to the Church as a nun ... hear me, hear me
... wait for the end of the story ... it is charming.
You are now about twenty-seven, I won't venture any
nearer your age. I don't know my mother's age."</p>

<p>"And no man will ever know it," said Anne. "Men
have no discretion about ages."</p>

<p>"Let me suppose," Arthur continued, "that fifty years
of service would be the limit of your active life. You
would then be seventy-seven, and there is no woman alive
as old as that. The oldest is under sixty."</p>

<p>"Unless the newspapers want to say that she's a hundred,"
said Anne slyly.</p>

<p>"For the sake of notoriety she is willing to have the
truth told about her age."</p>

<p>"As a school-teacher, a music-teacher, or a nurse, let
me say that your services might be valued at one thousand
a year for the fifty years, Honora. Do you think
that a fair average?"</p>

<p>"Very fair," said she indifferently.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to give that sum to the convent for
having deprived them of your pleasant company," said he.
"Hear me, hear me, ... I'm not done yet. I must be
generous, and I know your conscience will be tender a
long time, if something is not done to toughen it. I
want to be married in the new cathedral, which another
year will see dedicated. But a good round sum would
advance the date. We owe much to Monsignor. In your
name and mine I am going to give him enough to put the
great church in the way to be dedicated by November."</p>

<p>He knew the suffering which burned her heart that morning,
himself past master in the art of sorrow. That she
had come down from the heights to the common level
would be her grief forever; thus to console her would
be his everlasting joy.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it? Isn't it a fair release?"</p>

<p>"Only I am not worth it," she said. "But so much
the better, if every one gains more than I lose by my ... infatuation."</p>

<p>"Are you as much in love as that?" said Anne with
malice.</p>

<p>They were married with becoming splendor in January.
A quiet ceremony suggested by Honora had been promptly
overruled by Anne Dillon, who saw in this wedding a
social opportunity beyond any of her previous triumphs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Mrs. Dillon was not your mere aristocrat, who keeps exclusive
her ceremonious march through life. At that
early date she had perceived the usefulness to the aristocracy
of the press, of general popularity, and of mixed
assemblies; things freely and openly sought for by society
to-day. Therefore the great cathedral of the western
continent never witnessed a more splendid ceremony
than the wedding of Honora and Arthur; and no event
in the career of Anne Dillon bore stronger testimony to
her genius.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice of the nation headed the <i>élite</i>, among
whom shone like a constellation the Countess of Skibbereen;
the Senator brought in the whole political circle of
the city and the state; Grahame marshaled the journalists
and the conspirators against the peace of England; the
profession of music came forward to honor the bride; the
common people of Cherry Hill went to cheer their hero;
Monsignor drew to the sanctuary the clerics of rank to
honor the benefactor of the cathedral; and high above all,
enthroned in beauty, the Cardinal of that year presided
as the dispenser of the Sacrament.</p>

<p>As at the ordination of Louis the admirable Livingstone
sat among the attendant princes. For the third time within
a few months had he been witness to the splendors of
Rome now budding on the American landscape. He did
not know what share this Arthur Dillon had in the life of
Louis and in the building of the beautiful temple. But
he knew the strength of his leadership among his people;
and he felt curious to see with his own eyes, to feel with
his own heart, the charm, the enchantment, which had
worked a spell so fatal on the richly endowed Endicott
nature.</p>

<p>For enchantment there must have been. The treachery
and unworthiness of Sonia, detestable beyond thought,
could not alone work so strange and weird a transformation.
Half cynic always, and still more cynical since his late
misfortunes, he could not withhold his approbation from
the cleverness which grouped about this young man and
his bride the great ones of the hour. The scene wholly
depressed him. Not the grandeur, nor the presence of the
powers of society, but the sight of this Endicott, of the
mould of heroes, of the blood of the English Puritan,
acting as sponsor of a new order of things in his beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
country, the order which he had hoped, still hoped, to
destroy. His heart bled as he watched him.</p>

<p>The lovely mother, the high-hearted father, lay in their
grave. Here stood their beloved, a prince among men,
bowing before the idols of Rome, receiving for himself and
his bride the blessing of the archpriest of Romanism, a
cardinal in his ferocious scarlet. All his courage and
skill would be forever at the service of the new order.
Who was to blame? Was it not the rotten reed which he
had leaned upon, the woman Sonia, rather than these?
True it is, true it always will be, that a man's enemies are
they of his own household.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>A grand content filled the heart of Arthur. The bitterness
of his fight had passed. So long had he struggled
that fighting had become a part of his dreams, as necessary
as daily bread. He had not laid aside his armor even
for his marriage. Yet there had been an armistice, quite
unperceived, from the day of the cathedral's dedication.
He had lonely possession of the battle-field. His enemies
had fled. All was well with his people. They had
reached and passed the frontier, as it were, on that day
when the great temple opened its sanctuary to God and
its portals to the nation.</p>

<p>The building he regarded as a witness to the daring of
Monsignor; for Honora's sake he had given to it a third of
his fortune; the day of the dedication crowned Monsignor's
triumph. When he had seen the spectacle, he learned
how little men have to do with the great things of history.
God alone makes history; man is the tide which rushes in
and out at His command, at the great hours set by Him,
and knows only the fact, not the reason. In the building
that day gathered a multitude representing every form of
human activity and success. They stood for the triumph
of a whole race, which, starved out of its native seat, had
clung desperately to the land of Columbia in spite of persecution.</p>

<p>Soldiers sat in the assembly, witnesses for the dead of
the southern battle-fields, for all who had given life and
love, who had sacrificed their dearest, to the new land in
its hour of calamity. Men rich in the honors of commerce,
of the professions, of the schools, artists, journalists,
leaders, bore witness to the native power of a people, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
had been written down in the books of the hour as idle,
inferior, incapable by their very nature. In the sanctuary
sat priests and prelate, a brilliant gathering, surrounding
the delicate-featured Cardinal, in gleaming red, high on
his beautiful throne.</p>

<p>From the organ rolled the wonderful harmonies born of
faith and genius; from the pulpit came in sonorous English
the interpretation of the scene as a gifted mind perceived
it; about the altar the ancient ritual enacted the holy
drama, whose sublime enchantment holds every age.
Around rose the towering arches, the steady columns, the
broad walls, lighted from the storied windows, of the first
really great temple of the western continent!</p>

<p>Whose hands raised it? Arthur discovered in the answer
the charm which had worked upon dying Ledwith,
turned his failure into triumph, and his sadness into joy.
What a witness, an eternal witness, to the energy and
faith of a poor, simple, despised people, would be this
temple! Looking upon its majestic beauty, who could
doubt their powers, though the books printed English
slanders in letters of gold? Out of these great doors
would march ideas to strengthen and refresh the poor;
ideas once rejected, once thought destructible by the air
of the American wilderness. A conspiracy of centuries
had been unable to destroy them. Into these great portals
for long years would a whole people march for their
own sanctification and glory!</p>

<p>Thereafter the temple became for him a symbol, as
for the faithful priest; the symbol of his own life as
that of his people.</p>

<p>He saw it in the early dawn, whiter than the mist
which broke against it, a great angel whose beautiful feet
the longing earth had imprisoned! red with the flush
of morning, rosy with the tints of sunrise, as if heaven
were smiling upon it from open gates! clear, majestic,
commanding in the broad day, like a leader of the people,
drawing all eyes to itself, provoking the question, the
denial, the prayer from every passer, as tributes to its
power! in the sunset, as dying Ledwith had seen it,
flushed with the fever of life, but paling like the day,
tender, beseeching, appealing to the flying crowd for a
last turning to God before the day be done forever! in
the twilight, calm, restful, submissive to the darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
which had no power over it, because of the Presence
within! terrible when night falls and sin goes forth in
purple and fine linen, a giant which had heaved the earth
and raised itself from the dead stone to rebuke and
threaten the erring children of God!</p>

<p>He described all this for Honora, and, strangely enough,
for Livingstone, who never recovered from the spell cast
over him by this strange man. The old gentleman loved
his race with the fervor of an ancient clansman. For this
lost sheep of the house of Endicott he developed in time
an interest which Arthur foresaw would lead agreeably
one day to a review of the art of disappearing. He was
willing to satisfy his curiosity. Meanwhile, airing his
ideas on the providential mission of the country, and of
its missionary races, and combatting his exclusiveness, they
became excellent friends. Livingstone fell deeply in love
with Honora, as it was the fashion in regard to that
charming woman. For Arthur the circle of life had its
beginning in her, and with her would have its end.</p>
